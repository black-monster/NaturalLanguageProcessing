Already, though the morning was young, a fiery\\r\\nsun beat down on the sand so that heat waves shimmered in the air.\\r\\nOccasionally a spark from the crackling cottonwood limbs was caught by\\r\\na dust whirl and carried toward the field of ripe wheat bordering the\\r\\ncreek.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the campers there were three, all of the genus tramp, but each a\\r\\nvariant. They represented different types, these desert trekkers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gross man lying lazily under the shade of a clump of willows might\\r\\nhave stepped straight out of a vaudeville sketch. He was dirty and\\r\\nunkempt, his face bloated and dissipated. From his lax mouth projected\\r\\nan English brier pipe, uncleansably soiled. His clothes hung on him\\r\\nlike sacks, wrinkled and dusty, but not ragged. He was too good a hobo\\r\\nto wear anything torn or patched. It was his boast that he could get\\r\\nanother suit for the asking any time he needed one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a blowed-in-the-glass stiff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he bragged now. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrilled from Denver\\r\\nto \\xe2\\x80\\x99Frisco fifteen times, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 never was a stake man or a shovel bum.\\r\\nNot for a day, \\xe2\\x80\\x99boes. Ask any o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the push about old York. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ngive it to youse straight that he knows the best flops from Cincie to\\r\\nPhillie, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that no horstile crew can ditch him when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYork was a hobo pure and simple. It was his business in life. For\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstew-bums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgay-cats,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to use his own phraseology, he had a\\r\\nsupreme contempt. His companions were amateurs, from his point of view\\r\\nnon-professionals. Neither of them had any pride in turfing it, which\\r\\nis the blanket stiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expression for taking to the road. They did not\\r\\nunderstand York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vocabulary nor the ethics that were current in his\\r\\ncraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the thin, weasel-faced man with the cigarette drooping from his\\r\\nmouth was no amateur in his own line. He had a prison face, the\\r\\npeculiar distortion of one side of the mouth often seen in confirmed\\r\\ncriminals. His light-blue eyes were cold and dead. A film veiled them\\r\\nand snuffed out all expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCig\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called himself, and the name sufficed. On the road surnames\\r\\nwere neither asked for nor volunteered. York had sized him up three\\r\\ndays before when they had met at Colorado Springs, and he had passed on\\r\\nhis verdict to the third member of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA river rat on a vac--hittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the grit for a getaway,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he had\\r\\nwhispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis guess had been a good one. Cig had been brought up on the East\\r\\nRiver. He had served time in the penitentiaries of three States and\\r\\nexpected to test the hospitality of others. Just now he was moving\\r\\nwestward because the East was too hot for him. He and a pal had done a\\r\\njob at Jersey City during which they had been forced to croak a guy.\\r\\nHence his unwilling expedition to the Rockies. Never before had he\\r\\nbeen farther from the Atlantic than Buffalo, and the vast uninhabited\\r\\nstretches of the West bored and appalled him. He was homesick for the\\r\\nfetid dumps of New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corner of his mouth lifted in a sneer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWot\\xe2\\x80\\x99ell would any one want\\r\\nto cross this Gawd-forsaken country fifteen times for unless he was\\r\\nbughouse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you read the papes you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d know that travel is a lib\\xe2\\x80\\x99ral ejucation.\\r\\nDifference between a man an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a tree is that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got legs to move\\r\\naround with. You ginks on the East Side act like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re anchored to the\\r\\nBatt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ry an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Bowery. Me, I was born there, but I been batterin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on\\r\\nthe road ever since I was knee-high to a duck. A fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to throw\\r\\nhis feet if he wants to learn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d York announced dogmatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was obvious insult in Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s half-closed eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99S at what learned\\r\\nyou all youse know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get heavy, young feller,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d advised the blanket stiff. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve knew\\r\\nguys to stay healthy by layin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 off me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man cooking breakfast barked a summons. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 get it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramps moved forward to eat, forgetting for the moment their\\r\\nincipient quarrel. Into tin cups and plates the cook poured coffee\\r\\nand stew. In his light clean build, slender but well-packed, was the\\r\\npromise of the athlete. His movements disappointed this expectation.\\r\\nHe slouched, dragging the worn shoes through the cracks of which the\\r\\nflesh was visible. Of the three, he was the only one that was ragged.\\r\\nThe coat he wore, which did not match the trousers, was at the last\\r\\nextremity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne might have guessed his age at twenty-three or four. If it had\\r\\nnot been for the sullen expression in the eyes and the smoldering\\r\\ndiscontent of the face, he might have been good-looking. The reddish\\r\\nhair was short, crisp, and curly, the eyes blue as the Colorado summer\\r\\nsky above, the small head well-shaped and beautifully poised on the\\r\\nsloping column of the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the impression he made on observers was not a pleasant one. His\\r\\ngood points were marred by the spirit that found outlet in a sullen\\r\\nmanner that habitually grudged the world a smile. He had the skin\\r\\npigment of the blond, and in the untempered sun of the Rockies should\\r\\nhave been tanned to a rich red-brown. Instead, the skin was clammily\\r\\nunhealthy. The eyes were dulled and expressionless.\\r\\n\\r\\nYork ate wolfishly, occasionally using the sleeve of his coat for a\\r\\nnapkin. He talked, blatantly and continuously. Cig spoke only at rare\\r\\nintervals, the cook not at all. Within the silent man there simmered a\\r\\nnausea of disgust that included himself and all the universe in which\\r\\nhe moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the underworld caste rules more rigidly than in upper strata of\\r\\nsociety. The sense of superiority is everywhere an admission of\\r\\nweakness. It is the defense of one who lives in a glass house. Since\\r\\nall of these men were failures, each despised the others and cherished\\r\\nhis feeling that they were inferior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou \\xe2\\x80\\x99boes turf it with York an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always have plenty o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 punk and\\r\\nplaster,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the old tramp swaggered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComes to batterin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m there with\\r\\nbells on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslated into English, he meant that if they traveled with him they\\r\\nwould have bread and butter enough because he was a first-class beggar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo hear youse chew the rag you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a wiz, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig jeered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed you diggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up any Ritz-Carlton lunches a guy can write\\r\\nhome about. How about it, Tug?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe, I can tell a mark far as I can see him--know whether he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good\\r\\nfor a flop or a feed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d York continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnct I was ridin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the rods into\\r\\nOmaha--been punchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the wind till I was froze stiff, me \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a pal\\r\\ncalled Seattle. Shacks an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the con tried to ditch us. Nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 doing. We\\r\\nwas right there again when the wheels began to move. In the yards at\\r\\nOmaha we bumps into a gay-cat--like Tug here. He spills the dope that\\r\\nthe bulls are layin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for us. Some mission stiff had beefed on me. No\\r\\nguy with or without brass buttons can throw a scare into old York. No\\r\\ncan do. So I says to Seattle, says I--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYork\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story died in his throat. He stood staring, mouth open and chin\\r\\nfallen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men were standing on the edge of the bluff above the bed of the\\r\\ncreek. He did not need a second look to tell him that they had come to\\r\\nmake trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDE KING O\\xe2\\x80\\x99 PROOSHIA ON DE JOB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Reed came his foreman Lon Forbes with a story of three tramps\\r\\ncamping down by Willow Creek close to the lower meadow wheatfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranchman made no comment, unless it was one to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet out the\\r\\ncar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was a tight-lipped man of few words, sometimes grim. His\\r\\nmanner gave an effect of quiet strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the two were following the winding road through the pasture.\\r\\nA field of golden wheat lay below them undulating with the roll of the\\r\\nland. Through it swept the faintest ripple of quivering grain. The crop\\r\\nwas a heavy one, ripe for the reaper. Dry as tinder, a spark might set\\r\\na blaze running across the meadow like wildfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes pointed the finger of a gnarled hand toward a veil of smoke\\r\\ndrifting lazily from the wash. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown there, looks like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis employer nodded. They descended from the car and walked along the\\r\\nedge of the bank above the creek bed. Three men sat near a camp-fire.\\r\\nOne glance was enough to show that they were hoboes. Coffee in an old\\r\\ntomato can was bubbling over some live coals set between two flat\\r\\nstones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe big man with the bloated face was talking. The others were sulkily\\r\\nsilent, not so much listening as offering an annoyed refusal to be\\r\\nimpressed. The boaster looked up, and the vaporings died within him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you doing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded Reed. His voice was curt and hostile.\\r\\n\\r\\nYork, true to type, became at once obsequious. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo offense, boss. If\\r\\nthese here are private grounds--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the owner cut in sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hit the grit right away. No harm done, mister.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The voice\\r\\nof the blanket stiff had become a whine, sullen and yet fawning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner irritated both of his companions. Cig spoke first, out of\\r\\nthe corner of his mouth, slanting an insolent look up at the ranchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYouse de traffic cop on dis block, mister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLon Forbes answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know your sort an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want \\xe2\\x80\\x99em here. Shack!\\r\\nHit the trail pronto! No back talk about it either.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig looked at the big foreman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGawd!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he jeered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWotcha know about\\r\\nthat? De king o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Prooshia on de job again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bluff tanned Westerner took a step or two toward the ferret-faced\\r\\nman from the slums. Hurriedly York spoke up. He did not want anything\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstarted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There were stories current on the road of what ranchmen had\\r\\ndone to hoboes who had made trouble. He knew of one who had insulted a\\r\\nwoman and had been roped and dragged at a horse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heels till half dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 no harm, boss. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll beat it \\xe2\\x80\\x99f you say so. Gotta\\r\\nroll up our war bags.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed did not discuss the question of the harm they were doing. He knew\\r\\nthat a spark might ignite the wheat, but he did not care to plant the\\r\\nsuggestion in their minds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut out the fire and move on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\nharshly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDe king o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Prooshia an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 de clown prince,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig retorted with a lift of\\r\\nhis lip.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he shuffled forward and began to kick dirt over the fire with the\\r\\ntoe of his shoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed turned to the youngest tramp. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet water in that can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99 know about that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Up till now the tramp called Tug had not\\r\\nsaid a word. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not your slave. Get water yourself if you want to.\\r\\nAble-bodied, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rancher looked steadily at him, and the longer he looked, the less\\r\\nhe liked what he saw. A stiff beard bristled on the sullen face of the\\r\\ntramp. He was ragged and disreputable from head to heel. In the dogged\\r\\neyes, in straddling legs, in the half-clenched fist resting on one\\r\\nhip, Reed read defiance. The gorge of the Westerner rose. The country\\r\\nwas calling for men to get in its harvests. His own crops were ripe\\r\\nand he was short of hands. Yet this husky young fellow was a loafer.\\r\\nHe probably would not do a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work if it were offered him. He was\\r\\na parasite, the kind of ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99er-do-well who declines to saw wood for a\\r\\nbreakfast, metaphorically speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk back to me. Do as I say. Then get out of here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed did not lift his voice. It was not necessary. As he stood on the\\r\\nbank above the sand bed he conveyed an impression of strength in every\\r\\nline of his solid body. Even the corduroy trousers he wore folded\\r\\ninto the short laced boots seemed to have fallen into wrinkles that\\r\\nexpressed power. Close to fifty, the sap of virile energy still flowed\\r\\nin his veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fist on Tug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hip clenched. He flushed angrily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKind of a local\\r\\nGod Almighty on tin wheels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with a sneer.\\r\\n\\r\\nYork was rolling up his pack. Cig, grumbling, had begun to gather his\\r\\nbelongings. But the youngest tramp gave no evidence of an intention\\r\\nto leave. Nor did he make a move to get water to put out the still\\r\\nsmoldering fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rancher came down from the bank. Forbes was at his elbow. The\\r\\nforeman knew the signs of old. Reed was angry. Naturally imperious, he\\r\\ndid not allow any discussion when clearly within his rights. He would\\r\\nnot waste his force on such a spineless creature as York, but the\\r\\nyoungest tramp was of a different sort. He needed a lesson, and Lon\\r\\njudged he was about to get one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHear me? Get water and douse that fire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ranchman said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis steel-gray eyes were fastened to those of Tug. The tramp faced him\\r\\nsteadily. Forbes had a momentary surprise. This young fellow with the\\r\\npallid dead skin looked as though he would not ask for anything better\\r\\nthan a fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet it yourself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the hobo flung back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right fist of the ranchman lifted swiftly. It did not move far, but\\r\\nit carried great power back of it. The tramp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head snapped backward.\\r\\nHis shoulders hit the sand. He had been caught on the point of the jaw\\r\\nby a knock-out punch.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug came back to consciousness under the impression that he was\\r\\ndrowning in deep waters. Cig was dipping a can in the creek and sousing\\r\\nits contents over his head. He sat up dizzily. His uncertain gaze fell\\r\\non some one who had arrived since his exit from activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a young woman on horseback. He noticed that she was slender and\\r\\nhad a good seat. Her dark eyes watched him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho was she? What the dickens was she doing here? Where was he anyhow?\\r\\n\\r\\nHis glance swept the scene. York was stamping out the last embers\\r\\nof the fire. There was a bruise on Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheek and one of his eyes\\r\\nwas rapidly closing. From the fact that Forbes was examining abraded\\r\\nknuckles it was an easy guess that he had been in action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rancher, hands in coat pockets, relieved his mind in regard to the\\r\\nyouth he had knocked out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a good-for-nothing loafer, not fit to\\r\\nlive in a country that treats you too well. If I had charge of wastrels\\r\\nlike you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d put you on the rock-pile and work you to a frazzle. What\\r\\nuse are you, to yourself or any one else? When you were needed to fill\\r\\na uniform, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bet a dollar you were a slacker. You still are. A\\r\\nworthless, rotten-to-the-core hobo. Now get up and get off my land or\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you that thrashing you need.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug got up, swayed unsteadily on his feet, and lurched forward. In\\r\\nhis eyes, still dull and glazed from the shock his nervous system had\\r\\nendured, a gleam of anger came to life. He was a slacker, was he? All\\r\\nright. He would show this arrogant slave-driver that he could stand up\\r\\nand take all he had to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis rush was a poor leaden-footed shuffle, for he was shaky at the\\r\\nknees and weights dragged at his feet. The blow he aimed at Reed\\r\\nmissed the brown face half a foot. It was badly timed and placed. The\\r\\nranchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counter caught him flush on the cheekbone and flung him back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he gathered himself and plunged forward. Clinton Reed belonged to\\r\\nthe old fighting West. He had passed through the rip-roaring days of\\r\\nLeadville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime and later had been a part of Cripple Creek\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turbid\\r\\nlife. Always he had been a man of his hands. He punished his dazed\\r\\nopponent with clean hard blows, most of them started at short range to\\r\\nsave his own fists from the chance of broken or dislocated bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp fell into a clinch to get time for recovery. Reed jolted him\\r\\nout of it with a short arm left below the chin and followed with two\\r\\nslashing rights to the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hobo was in a bad way. In ring parlance, he was what is known as\\r\\ngroggy. His arms moved slowly and without force back of the blows. His\\r\\nknees sagged. There was a ringing in his head. He did not seem able to\\r\\nthink clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the will in him functioned to push him to more punishment. He\\r\\nattacked feebly. Through a weak defense the ranchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s driving arms\\r\\ntore cruelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug went down again. He tried to rise, but in spite of the best he\\r\\ncould do was unable to get up. The muscles of the legs would not\\r\\nco\\xc3\\xb6perate with the will.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome one in khaki riding-breeches flashed past him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough,\\r\\nDad. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care if he was impudent. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve hurt him enough. Let him\\r\\ngo now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure was the boyish one of the equestrienne, but the high\\r\\nindignant voice was feminine enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x99pose you try minding your own business, Bess,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father said\\r\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Dad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she expostulated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any trouble, do we? Make\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99em move on, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, Betty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained the foreman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t our\\r\\nfault if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a rookus. We told \\xe2\\x80\\x99em to light out, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they got\\r\\nsassy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug rose with difficulty. He was a badly hammered hobo. Out of swollen\\r\\nand discolored eyes he looked at the ranchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou quite through with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snarled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a last growl of defiance. His companions were already clambering\\r\\nwith their packs out of the wash to the bank above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clint Reed took his daughter by the shoulders and spun her\\r\\nout of the way when she tried to stop him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe fresh if you want to, my\\r\\nyoung wobbly. I reckon I can stand it if you can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He whirled the tramp\\r\\nround and kicked him away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Dad! Fighting with a tramp,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl wailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug swung round unsteadily, eyes blazing. He took a step toward the\\r\\nrancher. His glance fell on the girl who had just called him a tramp,\\r\\nand in saying it had chosen the last word of scorn. Her troubled,\\r\\ndisdainful gaze met his fully. The effect on him was odd. It paralyzed\\r\\naction. He stopped, breathing hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had called him a tramp, as one who belongs to another world might\\r\\ndo--a world that holds to self-respect and decency. He had read in her\\r\\nvoice utter and complete contempt for the thing he was. It was a bitter\\r\\nmoment. For him it stamped the low-water mark of his degradation. He\\r\\nfelt beneath her eyes a thing unclean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat she had said was true. He was a tramp. He had ridden the rods,\\r\\nasked for hand-outs, rough-housed with hoboes, slept with them. He had\\r\\njust been thoroughly thrashed and kicked before her. What was the use\\r\\nof resenting it? He had become declassed. Why should he not be kicked\\r\\nand beaten? That was the customary way to treat his kind of cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug swung heavily on a heel and followed his companions into the\\r\\nwillows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nONE OF THE LOST LEGION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the lost legion are two kinds of men. There are those who have\\r\\nkilled or buried so deep the divine fire of their manhood that for\\r\\nthem there seems no chance of recovery in this world. There are those\\r\\nin whom still burns somewhere a faint candle that may yet flame to a\\r\\ndynamic glow of self-respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young tramp slouching along the bank of Willow Creek drank deep of\\r\\nthe waters of despair. The rancher had called him a slacker, rotten to\\r\\nthe core. It was a true bill. He was a man spoiled and ruined. He had\\r\\nthrown away his life in handfuls. Down and dragging, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what he\\r\\nwas, with this damned vice a ball and chain on his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was in him some strain of ignoble weakness. There must be, he\\r\\nreasoned. Otherwise he would have fought and conquered the cursed\\r\\nthing. Instead, he had fought and lost. He could make excuses. Oh,\\r\\nplenty of them. The pain--the horrible, intolerable pain! The way the\\r\\ncraving had fastened on him before he knew it while he was still in the\\r\\nhospital! But that was piffling twaddle, rank self-deception. A man had\\r\\nto fight, to stand the gaff, to flog his evil yearnings back to kennel\\r\\nlike yelping dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis declension had been swift. It was in his temperament to go fast,\\r\\nto be heady. Once he let go of himself, it had been a matter of months\\r\\nrather than of years. Of late he had dulled the edge of his despair.\\r\\nThe opiates were doing their work. He had found it easier to live in\\r\\nthe squalid present, to forget the pleasant past and the purposeful\\r\\nfuture he had planned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now this girl, slim, clean, high-headed, with that searing contempt\\r\\nfor him in her clear eyes, had stirred up again the devils of remorse.\\r\\nWhat business had he to companion with these offscourings of the earth?\\r\\nWhy had he given up like a quitter the effort to beat back?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the cold waters of the creek he washed his swollen and bloodstained\\r\\nface. The cold water, fresh from the mountain snows, was soothing to\\r\\nthe hot bruised flesh even though it made the wounds smart. He looked\\r\\ndown into the pool and saw reflected there the image of himself.\\r\\nBeneath the eyes pouches were beginning to form. Soon now he would be a\\r\\ntypical dope fiend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still weak from the manhandling that had been given him. Into\\r\\nan inside coat pocket his fingers groped. They brought out with them a\\r\\nsmall package wrapped in cotton cloth. With trembling hands he made his\\r\\npreparations, bared an arm, and plunged the hypodermic needle into the\\r\\nflesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he took the trail again after his companions, Tug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were\\r\\nlarge and luminous. He walked with a firmer step. New life seemed to be\\r\\nflowing into his arteries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the dusty road cut the creek he found the other tramps waiting\\r\\nfor him. Their heads had been together in whispered talk. They drew\\r\\napart as he approached.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking note of Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purple eye and bruised face, Tug asked a question.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it the big foreman beat you up?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou done said it, \\xe2\\x80\\x99bo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the crook answered out of the side of his\\r\\nmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon you got off easy at that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug said bitterly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe boss\\r\\nbully didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do a thing to me but chew me up and spit me out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWotcha gonna do about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig growled significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glance was as much a question as his words. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\ncan I do but take it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes narrowed venomously. He lifted his upper lip in an ugly\\r\\nsneer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWatch my smoke. No roughneck can abuse me an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 get away with it.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna fix him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laughter barked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you fix him when you had a chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nasked ironically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCall that a chance? An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the big stiff wide as a door. \\xe2\\x80\\x99F I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d had a gun\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 croaked him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, if!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDe bulls frisked me gun in Denver. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get me a gat somewheres.\\r\\nAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when I do--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The sentence choked out in a snarl more threatening\\r\\nthan words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSounds reasonable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug jeered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen, \\xe2\\x80\\x99bo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig laid a hand on the sleeve of the young fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncoat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen. Are youse game to take a chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEyes filled with an expression of sullen distaste of Cig looked at him\\r\\nfrom a bruised and livid face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe I am. Maybe I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on\\r\\nyour mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna get that bird. See?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStick around an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gun him. Then hop a freight for \\xe2\\x80\\x99Frisco.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was in the lopsided face a certain dreadful eagerness that was\\r\\nappalling. Was this mere idle boasting? Or would the gangster go as far\\r\\nas murder for his revenge? Tug did not know. But his gorge rose at the\\r\\nfellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assumption that he would join him as a partner in crime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKill him without giving him a chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain there was a sound like the growl of a wild beast in the throat of\\r\\nthe Bowery tough. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWotcha givin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me! A heluva chance them guys give us\\r\\nwhen they jumped us. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn \\xe2\\x80\\x99em to keep their hands off Cig.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nadded, with a crackle of oaths, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe big stiffs!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exploded Tug with a surge of anger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have nothing to do with\\r\\nit--or with you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m through. You go one way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go another. Right\\r\\nhere I quit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former convict\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes narrowed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI getcha. Streak of yellow a foot\\r\\nwide. No more nerve than a rabbit. All right. Beat it. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose you\\r\\nnone too soon to suit me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two glared at each other angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nYork the peacemaker threw oil on the ruffled waters. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99S all right,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99boes. No use gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sore. Tug he goes one way, we hit the grit\\r\\nanother. Ev\\xe2\\x80\\x99rybody satisfied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug swung his roll of blankets across a shoulder and turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nBETTY RIDES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty Reed had watched unhappily the young tramp shuffle into the\\r\\nwillows and disappear. She felt depressed by a complex she could not\\r\\nanalyze. In part it was shame, for her father, for this tramp who\\r\\nlooked as though he were made for better things, for the whole squalid\\r\\nepisode; in part pity, not wholly divorced from admiration at the boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ninsolence and courage. He might be a wastrel, as her father had said.\\r\\nHe might be a ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99er-do-well. But by some sure instinct she knew that\\r\\nthere had been a time when he fronted with high hope to the future.\\r\\nThat momentary meeting of the eyes had told her as much.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething had killed him as surely as a bullet fired through the heart.\\r\\nThe boy he had been was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nLon Forbes chuckled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep going, I reckon, now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found\\r\\nout this ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no Hotel de Gink. You certainly handed that youngest bum\\r\\nhis hat, Clint. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say you did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that it was over Reed was not very well satisfied with his conduct.\\r\\nThe hobo had brought the punishment on himself. Still--there was\\r\\nsomething morally degrading about such an affray. One can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch pitch\\r\\nwithout paying the penalty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll begin cutting this field to-morrow, Lon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said shortly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHustle the boys up so\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to finish the mesa to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Across his\\r\\nshoulder he flung a question at the girl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou going to town, Bess?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn an hour or so. Want me to do something?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCall at Farrell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and see if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got in those bolts I ordered.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranchman strode to the car followed by Forbes. The foreman was\\r\\ntroubled by no doubts. His mind functioned elementally. If hoboes\\r\\ncamped on the Diamond Bar K and made themselves a danger to the crops,\\r\\nthey had to be hustled on their way. When they became insolent, it was\\r\\nnecessary to treat them rough. That was all there was to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty swung to the saddle and rode back to the house. She was returning\\r\\nfrom an inspection of a bunch of two-year-olds that were her own\\r\\nprivate property. She was rather well off in her own right, as the\\r\\nranch country counts wealth. The death of her uncle a year before had\\r\\nleft her financially independent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Betty cantered into the open square in front of the house, her\\r\\nfather and the foreman were getting out of the car. A chubby,\\r\\nflaxen-haired little lass came flying down the porch steps a-quiver\\r\\nwith excited delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Daddy, Daddy, what d\\xe2\\x80\\x99you fink? I went out to the barn\\r\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99--an\\xe2\\x80\\x99--an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I fink Fifi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got puppies, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause she--she--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThought I told you to stay away from the barn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ranchman chided.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis harsh voice dried up the springs of the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enthusiasm. She\\r\\ndrew back as though she had been struck. From the winsome, wee face\\r\\nthe eager, bubbling delight vanished, the enchanting dimples fled. The\\r\\nblue eyes became wells of woe. A small finger found the corner of the\\r\\nCupid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-bow mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nClint Reed, ashamed and angry at himself, turned away abruptly. Little\\r\\nRuth was the sunshine of his life, the last pledge of his dead wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlove, and he had deliberately and cruelly wounded her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging from the saddle, Betty ran to the porch. Her arms enfolded the\\r\\nchild and drew her tenderly close. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRuthie, tell big sister all about\\r\\nit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered gently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cD-d-d-daddy--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sobbing little girl began, and choked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaddy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worried, dear. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean to hurt your precious little\\r\\nfeelings. Tell Betty about Fifi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s puppies, darling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough her tears and between sobs Ruth told her great news. Presently\\r\\nshe forgot to weep and was led to the scene of Fifi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing and\\r\\nunique triumph. She gave little squeals of delight when Betty handed\\r\\nher a blind little creature to cuddle in spite of the indignant\\r\\nmother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protesting growls. The child held the warm white-and-brown\\r\\npuppy close to her bosom and adored it with her eyes. With reluctance\\r\\nshe returned it at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happiness was quite restored after her sister had given her a\\r\\nglass of milk and a cookie and sent her out to play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young woman waved her a smiling good-bye and went to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had some business letters to write and she went to the room that\\r\\nserved her as a library and office. The sound of the typewriter keys\\r\\ndrifted out of the open window for an hour or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl worked swiftly. She had a direct mind that found fluent\\r\\nexpression through the finger-tips. When she knew what she wanted to\\r\\nsay, it was never any trouble for Betty Reed to say it. A small pile\\r\\nof addressed and sealed letters lay in the rack on the desk before she\\r\\ncovered the machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese she took with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nClint Reed she found tinkering with a reaper that had gone temporarily\\r\\nout of service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWant anything more, Dad? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got that list I left on the desk. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all, except the bolts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky was a vault of blue. Not even a thin, long-drawn skein of cloud\\r\\nfloated above. A hot sun baked down on the dusty road over which Betty\\r\\ntraveled. Heat waves danced in front of her. There was no faintest\\r\\nbreath of breeze stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gold of autumn was creeping over the hills. Here and there was a\\r\\ncrimson splash of sumac or of maple against the almost universal yellow\\r\\ntoning. It seemed that the whole landscape had drunk in the summer\\r\\nsunshine and was giving it out now in a glow of warm wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl took a short cut over the hills. The trail led by way of draw,\\r\\ngulch, and open slope to the valley in which Wild Horse lay. She rode\\r\\nthrough the small business street of the village to the post-office.\\r\\nHere she bought supplies of the storekeeper, who was also post-master.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattell was his name. He was an amiable and harmless gossip. Wild Horse\\r\\ndid not need a newspaper as long as he was there to hand tobacco and\\r\\nlocal information across the counter. An old maid in breeches, Lon\\r\\nForbes had once called him, and the description serves well enough. He\\r\\nwas a whole village sewing circle in himself. At a hint of slander his\\r\\nsmall bright eyes would twinkle and his shrunken little body seem to\\r\\nwriggle like that of a pleased pup. Any news was good news to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning, Miss Betty. Right hot, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell the world. Ninety-nine in\\r\\nthe shade this very minute. Bart Logan was in to get Doc Caldwell for\\r\\nhis boy Tom. He done bust his laig fallin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 from the roof of the root\\r\\nhouse. Well, Bart was sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 your paw needs help right bad to harvest\\r\\nhis wheat. Seems like if the gov\\xe2\\x80\\x99ment would send out some of these here\\r\\nunemployed to work on the ranches it would be a good idee. Sometimes\\r\\nCongress acts like it ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got a lick o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sense.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty ordered coffee, sugar, tobacco, and other supplies. While he\\r\\nwaited upon her Battell made comment pertinent and impertinent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat Mecca brand o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 coffee seems to be right popular. Three pounds for\\r\\na dollar. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course, if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for the bunkhouse-- Oh, want it sent out\\r\\nto the Quarter Circle D E. How\\xe2\\x80\\x99re you makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it on your own ranch, Miss\\r\\nBetty? Some one was sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you would clean up quite a bit from your\\r\\nbeef herd this year, mebbe twelve or fifteen thousand. I reckon it was\\r\\nBart Logan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Bart keeping my books for me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl asked dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storekeeper cackled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFolks will gossip.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much is that corn meal a hundred?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCost you ten cents more\\xe2\\x80\\x99n the last. Folks talk about cost of livin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\ncoming down. Well, mebbe \\xe2\\x80\\x99tis an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mebbe \\xe2\\x80\\x99tain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I told Bart I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d cleared any twelve or fifteen thousand till I heard you\\r\\nsay so. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of money, if any one asks you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently Betty misunderstood him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re high, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take\\r\\ntwo sacks. Send it to the Quarter Circle and charge it to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty stopped at the railroad station to ask the agent about a shipment\\r\\nof goods her father was expecting, and from there went to Farrell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to\\r\\nfind out about the bolts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was well on toward noon when she took the road for home. At\\r\\nFour-Mile Crossing it intersected the railroad track. A man with a pack\\r\\non his back was plodding along the ties in the direction of Wild Horse.\\r\\nThe instant her eyes fell on him, the girl recognized the tramp her\\r\\nfather had beaten. The pallid face was covered with wheals and bruises.\\r\\nBoth of the sullen eyes were ringed with purple and black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey met face to face. Full into hers his dogged gaze challenged.\\r\\nWithout a word they passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty crossed the grade and followed a descent to a small grove of\\r\\npines close to the road. The sun was so hot that she decided to\\r\\ndismount and give the pony a breathing spell.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the saddle she swung, then trailed the reins and loosened the\\r\\ncinch.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sound brought her head round sharply. Two men had come over the brow\\r\\nof a little hill silently. One of them was almost at her elbow. A\\r\\ntwisted, malevolent grin was on his lips. He was the hobo Lon Forbes\\r\\nhad thrashed two or three hours ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWelcome to our city, goil,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he jeered in choice Boweryese. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonest to\\r\\nGawd, you knock me dead. Surest thing you know. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll treat you fine,\\r\\nnot like your dad an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that other big stiff did us. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not tell youse\\r\\nto move on, m\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dearie. Nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart felt as though drenched in ice-cold water. She had\\r\\nnot brought with her the small revolver she sometimes carried for\\r\\nrattlesnakes. Both instinct and observation told her this man was vile\\r\\nand dangerous. She was in his power and he would make her pay for what\\r\\nher father had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe trod down the fear that surged up in her bosom. Not for nothing\\r\\nhad she been all her life a daughter of the sun and the wind and wide\\r\\noutdoor spaces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI stopped to rest my pony from the heat of the sun,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou stopped to see old Cig,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he corrected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 now you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbe him an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you for a while. The hop-nut don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to de same push as\\r\\nus no longer. I shook him. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 York don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s man,\\r\\nYork ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slim girl in the riding-suit could not quite keep the panic out of\\r\\nher eyes. None of the motives that swayed the men she knew would have\\r\\nweight with him. He was both base and bold, and he had lived among\\r\\nthose who had small respect for a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glance moved to York. It found no comfort there. The gross\\r\\nhobo was soft as putty. He did not count, as his companion had openly\\r\\nsneered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, and made as though to tighten the\\r\\nloosened cinch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWon\\xe2\\x80\\x99cha? Think again, miss. Old Cig ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen a skirt since he left\\r\\nli\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 old New York. Sure as youse is a foot high he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hungry for a\\r\\nsweetie of his own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put his hand on her arm. At the touch her self-control vanished. She\\r\\nscreamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fingers slid down to the wrist and tightened. His other hand\\r\\nclamped over her mouth and cut off the cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe writhed, twisting to free herself. In spite of her slenderness she\\r\\nwas strong. From her lips she tore his hand and again called for help\\r\\nin an ecstasy of terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crook of his arm garroted her throat and cut off the air from her\\r\\nlungs. He bent her body back across his hip. Still struggling, she\\r\\nstrangled helplessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYouse would, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His voice, his narrowed eyes, exulted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForget it,\\r\\nmiss. Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an A1 tamer of Janes. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s de li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 old thing he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s de\\r\\nchampeen of de world at.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew her closer to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a soft sound of feet thudding across the grass. The arm\\r\\nabout Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s throat relaxed. She heard a startled oath, found herself\\r\\nflung aside. Her eyes opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly she knew why Cig had released her. The man stood crouched,\\r\\nsnarling, his eyes fixed on an approaching runner, one who moved with\\r\\nthe swift precision of a half-back carrying a ball down a whitewashed\\r\\ngridiron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe runner was the tramp whose face her father had battered to a pulp.\\r\\nHe asked for no explanations and made no comment. Straight for the\\r\\nreleased convict he drove.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig had not a chance. The bad air and food of the slums, late hours,\\r\\ndissipation, had robbed him of both strength and endurance. He held\\r\\nup his fists and squared off, for he was game enough. But Tug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fist\\r\\nsmashed through the defense as though it had been built of paper. The\\r\\nsecond-story man staggered back, presently went down before a rain of\\r\\nblows against which he could find no protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug dragged him to his feet, cuffed him hard with his half-closed fist\\r\\nagain and again, then flung him a second time to the ground. He stood\\r\\nover the fellow, his eyes blazing, his face colorless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet up, you hound!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered in a low voice trembling with anger.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet up and take it! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll teach you to lay hands on a woman!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig did not accept this invitation. He rolled away, caught up York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nheavy tramping stick, and stood like a wolf at bay, the lips lifted\\r\\nfrom his stained yellow teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTouch me again an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll knock your block off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he growled,\\r\\ninterlarding the threat with oaths and foul language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl begged of her champion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\r\\nRight away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed the young fellow, white to the lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nYork flat-footed forward a step or two. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo use havin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 no trouble. Cig\\r\\nhe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but a bit of fun, Tug. Old Cig wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do no\\r\\nlady any harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The tramp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice had taken on the professional whine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug fastened the girth, his fingers trembling so that he could hardly\\r\\nslip the leather through to make the cinch. Even in the reaction from\\r\\nfear Betty found time to wonder at this. He was not afraid. He had\\r\\nturned his back squarely on the furious gangster from the slums to\\r\\ntighten the surcingle. Why should he be shaking like a man in a chill?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl watched Cig while the saddle was being made ready. The eyes\\r\\nin the twisted face of the convict were venomous. If thoughts could\\r\\nhave killed, Tug would have been a dead man. She had been brought up\\r\\nin a clean world, and she did not know people could hate in such a\\r\\nsoul-and-body blasting way. It chilled the blood only to look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rescuer turned to help her into the saddle. He gave her the\\r\\nlift as one does who is used to helping a woman mount.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the seat she stooped and said in a low voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you to go\\r\\nwith me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded. Beside the horse he walked as far as the road. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy pack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nback there on the track,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and stopped, waiting for her to ride\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty looked down at him, a troubled frown on her face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are you\\r\\ngoing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA bitter, sardonic smile twitched the muscles of the bruised face. He\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooking for work?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe I am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need men on the Diamond Bar K to help with the harvest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ranch where I was kicked off?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quick-tempered, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s square. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk with him about\\r\\nyou--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy waste your time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he mocked mordantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not impose on him\\r\\na good-for-nothing loafer, a worthless rotten-to-the-core hobo, a\\r\\nslacker, a wastrel who ought to be on a rock-pile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDad didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean all that. He was angry. But if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to work\\r\\nfor him, perhaps you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d work for me. I own a ranch, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked up the road into the dancing heat waves. She was wasting\\r\\npity on him, was she? No doubt she would like to reform him. A dull\\r\\nresentment burned in him. His sulky eyes looked into hers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m particular about who I work for,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told her brutally.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe winced, but the soft dark eyes were still maternally tender for\\r\\nhim. He had fought for her, had saved her from a situation that held at\\r\\nleast degradation and perhaps horrible despair. Moreover, young though\\r\\nhe was, she knew that life had mauled him fearfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI need men. I thought perhaps--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou thought wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry--about Father. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to see him if you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwant to. The Quarter Circle D E is four miles from the Diamond Bar K.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said bluntly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer good intentions were at an _impasse_. The road was blocked. But\\r\\nshe could not find it in her heart to give up yet, to let him turn\\r\\nhimself adrift again upon a callous world. He needed help--needed it\\r\\ndesperately, if she were any judge. It was written on his face that he\\r\\nwas sailing stormy seas and that his life barque was drifting toward\\r\\nthe rocks. What help she could give she must press upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m asking you to be generous and forget what--what we did to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe pleaded, leaning down impulsively and putting a hand on his\\r\\nshoulder. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou saved me from that awful creature. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it your turn\\r\\nnow to let me help you if I can?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why not? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for work. I need men. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be\\r\\nreasonable for us to get together on terms?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her smile was very sweet\\r\\nand just a little wistful, her voice vivid as the sudden song of a\\r\\nmeadow-lark.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the warmth of her kindness his churlishness melted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m much obliged. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use. Your father\\r\\nhad the right of it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not any good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. Your life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got twisted somehow. But you can\\r\\nstraighten it. Let me help. Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? Because of what you did for me\\r\\njust now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer hand moved toward him in a tentative offer of friendship.\\r\\nAutomatically his eyes recorded that she wore a diamond ring on the\\r\\nthird finger. Some lucky fellow, probably some clean young man who had\\r\\ngiven no hostages to vice, had won her sweet and gallant heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was all eager desire and sympathy. For a moment, as he looked into\\r\\nthe dusky, mobile face that expressed a fine and gallant personality,\\r\\nit seemed possible for him to trample down the vice that was destroying\\r\\nhim. But he pushed this aside as idle sentiment. His way was chosen for\\r\\nhim and he could not go back.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head and turned away. The bitter, sardonic smile again\\r\\nrested like a shadow of evil on his good-looking face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nTUG IS \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCOLLECTED\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTug followed the rails toward Wild Horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe groped in an abyss of humiliation and self-disgust. Slacker! The\\r\\ncattleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scornful word had cut to the quick. The taste of it was\\r\\nbitter. For he had not always been one. In war days he had done his\\r\\nshare.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was it McCrae\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poem ran?\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are the Dead. Short days ago\\r\\n  We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\\r\\n    Loved and were loved, and now we lie\\r\\n      In Flanders fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake up our quarrel with the foe:\\r\\n  To you from failing hands we throw\\r\\n    The torch; be yours to hold it high.\\r\\n    If ye break faith with us who die\\r\\n  We shall not sleep, though poppies grow\\r\\n      In Flanders fields.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had kept the faith in France, but he was not keeping it now.\\r\\nThe obligation was as binding on him in peace as on the battle-field.\\r\\nHe knew that. He recognized it fully. But when the pain in his head\\r\\nbegan, his mind always flew to the only relief he knew. The drug had\\r\\nbecome a necessity to him. If the doctors had only let him fight it out\\r\\nfrom the beginning without help, he would not have become accustomed to\\r\\nthe accursed stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what was the use of going over that again and again? He was done\\r\\nfor. Why send his thoughts forever over the same treadmill?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flaming sun poured down into the bowl of the valley and baked its\\r\\ncontents. He moved from the track to the shade of a cottonwood and lay\\r\\ndown. His racing thoughts grew more vague, for the hot sun had made him\\r\\nsleepy. Presently his eyes closed drowsily. They flickered open and\\r\\nslowly shut a second time. He began to breathe deeply and regularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun passed the zenith and began to slide down toward the western\\r\\nhills. Still Tug slept.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dreamed. The colonel was talking to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOver the top, Hollister,\\r\\nat three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock. Ten minutes now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He shook himself out of sleep. It\\r\\nwas time to get busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly he came back blinking to a world of sunshine. Two men stood over\\r\\nhim, both armed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMust be one of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the shorter of the two said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure thing. See his outfit. All rags. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll collect him an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 take him\\r\\nback to the ranch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were cowboys or farmhands, Tug was not sure which. He knew at\\r\\nonce, however, that their intentions were not friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the short, stocky one answered curtly. He wore a big\\r\\nbroad-rimmed hat that was both ancient and dusty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInteresting. You a sheriff? Got a warrant for me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man raised the point of his thirty-eight significantly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this warrant enough?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the trouble? What d\\xe2\\x80\\x99you want me for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell him, Dusty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the lank cowboy said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, Burt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To the tramp he said roughly: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn you how\\r\\nto treat a lady. Get up. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna trail back to the Diamond Bar K\\r\\nwith us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the wrong man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained Tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re jus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 travelin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 through the country lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nDusty jeered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard that li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 spiel before. Why, you chump, the\\r\\nol\\xe2\\x80\\x99 man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s autograph is writ on yore face right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug opened his mouth to expostulate, but changed his mind. What was the\\r\\nuse? He had no evidence. They would not let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guess you hold the aces.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He rose, stiffly, remarking to the world\\r\\nat large, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read about those three-gallon hats with a half-pint of\\r\\nbrains in them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDusty bridled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get gay with me, young feller. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not stand for\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d murmured the hobo, and he somehow contrived to make of the\\r\\nmonosyllable a taunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust for that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll drag you back with a rope.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDusty handed his weapon to the other cowboy, stepped to his horse, and\\r\\nbrought back a rope. He uncoiled it and dropped the noose over the\\r\\ntramp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head, tightening it around his waist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe riders swung to their saddles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet a move on you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dusty ordered, giving the rope a tug. The other\\r\\nend of it he had fastened to the horn of the saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug walked ahead of the horses through the sand. It was a long hot\\r\\ntramp, and Dusty took pains to make it as unpleasant as possible. If\\r\\nthe prisoner lagged, he dragged him on the ground, gibing at him, and\\r\\nasking him whether he would insult another woman next time he got a\\r\\nchance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowpuncher found small satisfaction in the behavior of the man at\\r\\nthe other end of the rope. The ragged tramp neither answered his sneers\\r\\nnor begged for mercy. He took what was coming to him silently, teeth\\r\\nclamped tight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Burt interfered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be about enough, Dusty. The old\\r\\nman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna settle with him. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his say-so about what he wants done\\r\\nto this guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added, a moment later: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so darned sure we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ngot the right one, anyhow. This bird don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look to me like a feller who\\r\\nwould do a girl a meanness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHmp! You always was soft in the head, Burt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his companion grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he left his prisoner in peace after that. Burt had said one true\\r\\nword. Clint Reed would not want a half-dead hobo dragged to the Diamond\\r\\nBar K. He would prefer one that he could punish himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug plodded through the fine white dust that lay inches deep on the\\r\\nroad. A cloud of it moved with them, for the horses kicked it up at\\r\\nevery step until they ascended from the valley into the hills. The\\r\\nman who walked did not have the reserve of strength that had been his\\r\\nbefore he had gone to the hospital. There had been a time when he could\\r\\ngo all day and ask for more, but he could not do it now. He stumbled as\\r\\nhe dragged his feet along the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached the summit of the pass and looked down on the Diamond\\r\\nBar K. Its fenced domain was a patchwork of green and gold with a\\r\\nbackground of pineclad ridges. The green patches were fields of\\r\\nalfalfa, the gold squares were grain ripe for the mower.\\r\\n\\r\\nDownhill the going was easier. But by the time the horsemen and their\\r\\nprisoner drew up to the ranch house, Tug was pretty well exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dusty went in to get Reed, the tramp sat on the floor of the\\r\\nporch and leaned against a pillar, his eyes closed. He had a ridiculous\\r\\nfeeling that if he let go of himself he would faint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNOTHING BUT A GAY-CAT ANYHOW\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an unusual depression Betty had watched the tramp move down the\\r\\ndusty road to the railroad track after he had declined her offer of\\r\\nemployment. An energetic young person, she was accustomed to having\\r\\nher own way. One of her earliest delightful discoveries had been that\\r\\nshe could nearly always get what she wanted by being eager for it and\\r\\nassuming that, of course, the others involved would recognize her plan\\r\\nas best, or at least would give up theirs cheerfully when she urged\\r\\nhers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this ragged scamp, out of whose heart youth and hope had been\\r\\ntrampled, was leaving her dashed and rebuffed. She liked to make\\r\\nconquests of people in bending them to the schemes she made for the\\r\\nregulation of her small universe, though she would have denied even\\r\\nto herself that she liked to manage her friends. In the case of this\\r\\ndrear-eyed boy, the hurt was not only to her vanity. He might be five\\r\\nor six years older than she, but the mothering instinct--the desire to\\r\\nsave him from himself and his fate--fluttered yearningly toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not blame him. There was at least a remnant of self-respect in\\r\\nhis decision. Nobody wants to be done good to. Perhaps she had seemed\\r\\nsmug to him, though she had not meant to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was on her mind all the way back to the ranch, so much so that she\\r\\nblurted out the whole story to her father as soon as she saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\nClint Reed moved to prompt action. He did not see eye to eye with his\\r\\ndaughter. What concerned him was that these bums should waylay and\\r\\ninsult Betty. It was a nice state of affairs when a girl was not safe\\r\\nalone on the roads. He gathered his men and gave them orders to find\\r\\nthe hoboes and bring them to the ranch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protest was lost on Reed. It hardly reached his mind at\\r\\nall. Besides, this had become public business. It was not her personal\\r\\naffair. If hoboes needed to be taught a sense of decency, the men of\\r\\nthe community would attend to that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty went into the house dissatisfied with herself. She had not meant\\r\\nto make more trouble, but to enlist her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sympathy in the cause\\r\\nof the young fellow who had saved her from the other tramp. As for the\\r\\none who had attacked her, she did not care whether he was punished or\\r\\nnot. She had much rather no hue and cry over the country was made about\\r\\nit. Though she did not say so, she hoped the vagrants would get away\\r\\nuncaught.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe busied herself with household duties. Under her direction and\\r\\nwith her help, Bridget the cook was putting up half a dozen boxes of\\r\\npeaches. The two women worked into the middle of the hot afternoon\\r\\nbefore they had finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bridget said with a sigh of relief as she sealed the\\r\\nlast jar. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFegs, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind a hotter day this summer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a b\\xe2\\x80\\x99iler.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an old family servant and was in part responsible for the\\r\\nbringing up of Betty. More than one rancher in the neighborhood had\\r\\nattempted the adventure of wooing Bridget Maloney, but none of them had\\r\\nbeen able to lure her from the Diamond Bar K to become the mistress of\\r\\na home of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better lie down and sleep an hour, dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl advised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 phwat would I be doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that for wid all these kettles an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pots to\\r\\nbe cleaned up? Scat! Get ye out o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 my kitchen now, mavourneen, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nredd up in a jiff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty found a magazine and walked out to the shade of a pine grove\\r\\nwhere a hammock hung. She settled herself comfortably and began to\\r\\nread. It was delightfully cool among the pines after the hot kitchen.\\r\\nShe grew drowsy. Her eyes closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of far-away voices was in her ears when she wakened. As her\\r\\nthoughts cleared, so did the voices. She heard Dusty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, strident,\\r\\ntriumphant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to the old man now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl turned in the hammock and saw the squat cowpuncher go jingling\\r\\ninto the house. Burt lounged on a horse, his right leg thrown round\\r\\nthe horn of the saddle. Some one else, partly hidden from her by the\\r\\nponies, was sitting on the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up quickly and walked toward the house. The man on the porch,\\r\\nshe saw presently, had a rope around his waist the other end of which\\r\\nwas fastened to the saddle of Dusty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mount. An eyeflash later she\\r\\nrecognized him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp called Tug rose. He did not lift his hat, for he no longer\\r\\nhad one. But his bow and sardonic smile gave an effect of ironic\\r\\npoliteness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bad penny back again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have they been doing to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been a disreputable enough specimen when she had last seen him.\\r\\nThe swollen and discolored face, the gaping shoes, the ragged coat;\\r\\nall of these he had carried then. But there were scratches like skin\\r\\nburns down one side of the jaw and on his hands that had come since.\\r\\nHis coat was in shreds. From head to foot dust covered every available\\r\\ninch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour men have been having a little sport. Why not? The boss had his\\r\\nfirst and they had to follow his example. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good obedient boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe scoffed bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? What did they do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders and she turned imperiously to the man on\\r\\nhorseback. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurt, you tell me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lank cowboy showed embarrassment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Dusty he--he kinda dragged\\r\\nhim when the fellow lagged. Jus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for a ways.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the ground? That what you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The dark eyes flashed anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, you might say so. He sorta stumbled, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been right sassy\\r\\nto Dusty, so--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Burt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explanation died away. He felt he was not\\r\\ngetting very far with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you acted like brutes to him--to a man who had just fought for me\\r\\nwhen--when--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A sob of chagrin and vexation choked up in her throat.\\r\\nShe stamped her foot in exasperation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get excited about me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the victim gibed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m nothing but a\\r\\ngay-cat anyhow. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDusty strutted out of the house, his spurs making music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl turned on him with pantherish swiftness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho told you to torture this man, Dusty? What right have you got to\\r\\nmake yourself law on the Diamond Bar? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only a drunken lunkhead,\\r\\naren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? Or did Father ask you to be judge and jury on the ranch?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was ludicrous to see the complacency vanish from the fatuous face.\\r\\nThe jaw fell and the mouth opened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Miss Betty, I figured as how he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d done you a meanness, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\r\\nthought--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cut his explanation short with stinging ruthlessness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for?\\r\\nYou weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hired to think, but to obey orders. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better get back\\r\\ninto the wheatfield before Father comes. Pronto.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowboy shut his mouth with a view to opening it again in\\r\\nself-defense, but Betty would have none of his excuses. She shooed him\\r\\nfrom the scene indignantly. While she was busy with Dusty, the lank\\r\\nrider quietly vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner watched her, the rope still about his waist. His mind paid\\r\\ntribute to the energy with which she got results.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreatly obliged,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with sarcasm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose your father won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nhave me hanged now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake off that rope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an order, is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame you for hating us all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she flamed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would in your\\r\\nplace. The whole place is bewitched to-day, I believe. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all acting\\r\\nlike bullies instead of the quiet, decent people we are. Take Dusty\\r\\nnow. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good little fellow, but he thought you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d attacked me. He\\r\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand that. Men in the ranch country won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, you know. They\\r\\nlook after us women.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a peculiarity of the ranch country, I suppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ignored the derisive gleam in his eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo ... no! Good men always\\r\\ndo. I wish I could tell you--could show you--my thanks because you\\r\\nstood up for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never forget. It was fine, the way you fought\\r\\nfor me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing to that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been saving a punch or two for him. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget\\r\\nthat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a good-for-nothing bum, on the authority of your own father.\\r\\nNo need of getting sentimental. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the mistake of putting me in\\r\\na class with him and other such truly good men as your friend Dusty and\\r\\nthe lamblike foreman who beat up Cig because he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t apologize for\\r\\nbeing alive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVoice and manner both fleered at her, but she was determined to accept\\r\\nno rebuff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid Dusty hurt you? Can I do anything for you? Tell me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be so glad\\r\\nto. Let me get you a drink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a flash, she was off at her own suggestion to the kitchen. His\\r\\nimpulse was to go at once, but he could not escape his past and be\\r\\ndeliberately discourteous to a woman whose only desire was to help him.\\r\\nHe waited, sullenly, for her return. Why could she not let him alone?\\r\\nAll he asked of the Diamond Bar K was for it to let him get away and\\r\\nforget it as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the girl came back, it was with a pitcher and a glass. The outside\\r\\nof the jug was beaded with moisture. From within came the pleasant\\r\\ntinkle of ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty filled the tumbler with lemonade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vagabond had no desire to accept the hospitality of the ranch, but\\r\\nhe found it impossible to affront her churlishly again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and drank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drink was refreshing. Two fresh-beaten eggs had been stirred into\\r\\nit for nutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she begged, and poured without waiting for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ghost of a smile crept into his eyes. It was the first hint of\\r\\nwholesome humor she had yet seen in him. He offered her, with a little\\r\\nbow, a quotation.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I can no other answer make, but thanks,\\r\\n  And thanks, and ever thanks.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dimples broke into her cheeks as her smile flashed out in the\\r\\npleasure of having broken the crust of his reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shakespeare, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dreadfully illiterate, but it sounds\\r\\nlike him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt does a little, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He raised the glass before drinking.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHappy days, Miss Reed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat goes double,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sardonic mask, that had for a moment been lifted, dropped again\\r\\nover his face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany more like this one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he fleered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may look back on it and find it a good day yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said bravely.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed back the empty tumbler. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfraid I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not an optimist. Now, if\\r\\nyou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going. The ranch might change its mind about\\r\\nthat hanging bee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I do mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she protested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want you to go yet. Please\\r\\nstay and meet my father. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really hard and cruel as you think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she saw on his lips the dry, bitter smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take your word for it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met him once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t met him--not to know him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried softly, giving\\r\\nrein to swift impulse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not met my Daddy--the best man in\\r\\nParadise Valley. You can ask any one about him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the squarest that\\r\\never was. The man you met was exasperated and--and not himself. Dad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot like that--really.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His voice was a compound of incredulity and indifference. It\\r\\nput her out of court.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her good impulses were not easily daunted. She had already learned\\r\\nthat this young fellow wore armor of chain-mail to protect his\\r\\nsensitive pride. In her horoscope it had been written that she must\\r\\ngive herself, and still give and give. The color beat through her dusky\\r\\ncheeks beneath the ardent eyes. She stabbed straight at his jaundiced\\r\\nsoul.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it were my father only that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like--but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t--you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nfind joy in anything. Your mind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poisoned. I was reading the other\\r\\nday how Mr. Roosevelt used to quote from Borrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lavengro\\xe2\\x80\\x99: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Life is\\r\\nsweet, brother--there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day and night, brother; both sweet things; sun,\\r\\nmoon, and stars, all sweet things--and likewise there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wind on the\\r\\nheath.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because he felt this in everything he did that they called\\r\\nhim \\xe2\\x80\\x98Greatheart.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to him that the name might not inaptly be applied to her. He\\r\\nthought of Browning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Last Duchess\\xe2\\x80\\x9d:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c... She had\\r\\n  A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,\\r\\n  Too easily impressed: she liked whate\\xe2\\x80\\x99er\\r\\n  She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hardened his heart to her generous appeal to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very\\r\\ncomfortable point of view to have,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with no spring of life in\\r\\nhis voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd a true one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added swiftly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you say so, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His skeptical smile made no concessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to leave, but stopped to look at a cloud of white dust moving\\r\\ndown the road toward them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nTUG SAYS, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNO, THANK YOU\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advancing dust cloud rose from a little group of horses and men.\\r\\nSome of the latter were riding. Others were afoot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caught them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Betty. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so sorry as they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned the ragged youth grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman swung heavily from his horse. Though he was all muscle and\\r\\nbone, he did not carry his two hundred pounds gracefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got the birds all right, Miss Betty, even if they were hittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nthe trail right lively,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called to the girl, an ominous grin on\\r\\nhis leathery face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guess they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d figured out this wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no healthy\\r\\nclimate for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added, with a swift reversion to business,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yore paw?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot back yet. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll he do with them, Lon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl asked, her voice\\r\\nlow and troubled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistressed in soul, she was looking for comfort. The big foreman gave\\r\\nher none.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do a plenty. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to worry about that. We aim to keep\\r\\nthis country safe for our womenfolks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I wish he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I wish he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d let them go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, almost in\\r\\na wail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Clint ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that soft.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Forbes stared at the disreputable\\r\\nvagrant standing beside Betty. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he doing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDusty dragged him back. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all the sense he has.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLon spoke just as though the vagrant were not present. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucky for him\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got an alibi this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it necessary to insult him after he protected me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl\\r\\ndemanded, eyes flashing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ashamed of you, Lon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was taken aback. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon it takes more\\xe2\\x80\\x99n that to insult a hobo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs a man a hobo because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking for work?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard gaze took in the man, his white face and soft hands.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat would he do if he found it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked bluntly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve no right to say that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she flung back. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hateful\\r\\nthe way you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all acting. I tell you he fought for me--after what\\r\\nFather did to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFought for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was news to Lon. His assumption had been that\\r\\nthe young fellow had merely entered a formal protest in order to clear\\r\\nhimself in case retribution followed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean with his fists?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes--against the thin-faced one. He thrashed him and put me on my\\r\\nhorse and started me home. Then Dusty ropes him and drags him here on\\r\\nthe ground and you come and insult him. He must think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a grateful\\r\\nlot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they looked at the slim, vital girl confronting him with such\\r\\npassionate and feminine ferocity, the eyes of the foreman softened.\\r\\nAll her life she had been a part of his. He had held her on his knee,\\r\\na crowing baby, while her dimpled fingers clung to his rough coat or\\r\\nexplored his unshaven face. He had fished her out of an irrigation\\r\\nditch when she was three. He had driven her to school when for the\\r\\nfirst time she started on that great adventure. It had been under his\\r\\ndirection that she had learned to ride, to fish, to shoot. He loved her\\r\\nas though she had been flesh of his flesh and blood of his blood. It\\r\\nwas a delight to him to be bullied by her and to serve her whims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI renig,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClint never told me the boy done that. I had it\\r\\ndoped out he was just savin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 his own hide. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take it all back if\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like you say. Shake, son.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp did not refuse to grip the big brown hand thrust at him. Nor\\r\\ndid he accept the proffered alliance. By a fraction of a second he\\r\\nforestalled the foreman by stooping to knot a broken lace in one of the\\r\\ngaping shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig, who had been edging closer, gave Tug a rancorous look. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nforgettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he promised. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get youse good some day for\\r\\nrappin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell on you. Some of my men brought him here in the gather\\r\\nlike we did you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Forbes explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWot\\xe2\\x80\\x99ell youse givin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me? He rapped. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wot he done, the big stiff.\\r\\nAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll soitainly get him right for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat kind of talk ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t helpin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you any,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\r\\ngot any sense, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll shut yore trap an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 take what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take it. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t youse worry about that. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better kill me while\\r\\nyouse are on the job, for I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get you, too, sure as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a mont\\xe2\\x80\\x99 old.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed drove up in the old car he used for a runabout. He killed the\\r\\nengine, stepped down, and came up to the group by the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee you rounded \\xe2\\x80\\x99em up, Lon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep. Found \\xe2\\x80\\x99em in the cottonwoods acrost the track at Wild Horse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominant eyes found Tug. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowcome you here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gay-cat looked at him in sullen, resentful silence. The man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmanner stirred up in the tramp a flare of opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDusty brought him here. I want to tell you about that, Dad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLater.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He turned to Tug. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want a talk with you--got a proposition\\r\\nto make you. See you later.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot if I see you first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ragged nomad replied insolently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never\\r\\ndid like bullies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranchman flushed angrily, but he put a curb on his temper. He could\\r\\nnot afford to indulge it since he was so much in this youth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt.\\r\\nAbruptly he turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring the other two to the barn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered Forbes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a\\r\\nsettlement there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYork shuffled forward, in a torment of fear. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee here, mister. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ngot a thing to do with this. Honest to Gawd, I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Ask Tug. Ask the\\r\\nyoung lady. I got respeck for women, I have. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do dirt to an\\r\\nold \\xe2\\x80\\x99bo wot never done you no harm, would you, boss?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice was a whine. The big gross man was on the verge of\\r\\nblubbering. He seemed ready to fall on his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, Dad. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said in a low voice to her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStood by, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he? Never lifted a hand for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou go into the house. Leave him to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ordered Reed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep this\\r\\nyoung man here till I come back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty knew when words were useless with her father. She turned away and\\r\\nwalked to the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowpunchers with their prisoners moved toward the barn. York,\\r\\nululating woe, had to be dragged.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft alone with the tramp called Tug, Betty turned to him a face of\\r\\ndread. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go into the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said drearily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better go in. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking the road now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut Father wants to see you. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll wait just a little--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no business with him. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care to see him, now or any\\r\\ntime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His voice was cold and hard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you for the lemonade, Miss\\r\\nReed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say good-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not offer his hand, but as he turned away he bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing more for Betty to say except \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a small voice of distress she murmured it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes followed him as far as the road. A sound from the barn drove\\r\\nher into the house, to her room, where she could cover her ears with\\r\\nthe palms of her small brown hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not want to hear any echo of what was taking place there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nA RIFT IN THE LUTE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the cool of the evening Justin Merrick drove down from the\\r\\nSweetwater Dam to the Diamond Bar K ranch. It was characteristic of him\\r\\nthat his runabout was up to date and in perfect condition. He had an\\r\\nexpensive taste in the accessories of life, and he either got the best\\r\\nor did without.\\r\\n\\r\\nHands and face were tanned from exposure to the burning sun of the\\r\\nRockies, but he was smooth-shaven and immaculate in the engineer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suit\\r\\nwhich fitted his strong, heavy-set figure so snugly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drove with precision, as he did everything else in his well-ordered\\r\\nlife. There was in his strength no quality of impatience or turbulence.\\r\\nHe knew what he wanted and how to get it. That was why he had traveled\\r\\nso far on the road to success and would go a great way farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-night he anticipated two pleasant hours with Betty Reed. He would\\r\\ntell her about the work and how it was getting along, his difficulties\\r\\nwith the sand formation at the head gates and how he was surmounting\\r\\nthem. Even before she spoke, he would know from her eager eyes that she\\r\\nwas giving him the admiration due a successful man from his sweetheart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterward he would pass to more direct and personal love-making, which\\r\\nshe would evade if possible or accept shyly and reluctantly. She was\\r\\nwearing his ring, but he doubted whether he had really stormed the\\r\\ninner fortress of her heart. This uncertainty, and the assurance\\r\\nthat went with it of a precious gift not for the first chance comer,\\r\\nappealed to his fastidious instinct, all the more that he was sure she\\r\\nwould some day come to him with shining eyes and outstretched hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-night Merrick found Betty distrait and troubled. Her attention to\\r\\nthe recital of his problems was perfunctory. He was conscious of a\\r\\nslight annoyance. In spite of his force, Justin was a vain man, always\\r\\nready to talk of himself and his achievements in a modest way to an\\r\\ninterested and interesting young woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared that her father had had a difficulty with some tramps,\\r\\nwhich had eventuated in insolence that had brought upon the vagrants\\r\\nsummary physical punishment. From her account of it, Justin judged that\\r\\nReed had not handled the matter very wisely. There was a way to do such\\r\\nthings with a minimum of friction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he saw no need of worrying about it. The tramps had been given what\\r\\nthey deserved and the affair was closed. It was like a woman to hold it\\r\\nheavily on her conscience because one of the ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99er-do-wells chanced to\\r\\nbe young and good-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d seen him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty protested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA gentleman by the look of him,\\r\\nor had been once, fine-grained, high-spirited, and yet so down-and-out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down-and-out, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his own fault. A man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never that so long\\r\\nas he holds to self-respect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was incontrovertibly true, but Betty chose to be irritated. Justin\\r\\nwas so obviously successful. He might have had a little sympathy for\\r\\nthe underdog, she thought. Everybody did not have a square, salient jaw\\r\\nlike his. Weakness was not necessarily a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe looks as though life had mauled him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taken\\r\\nsomething vital out of him. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care what happens any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he can only mooch his three meals a day and enough cash to keep him\\r\\nsupplied with bootleg poison,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer added.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were walking up to the Three Pines, a rocky bluff from which they\\r\\ncould in the daytime see far down the valley. She stopped abruptly. If\\r\\nshe did not stamp her foot, at least the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manner gave eloquently\\r\\nthe effect of this indulgence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like that at all--not at all. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you ever sympathize with\\r\\nany one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in hard luck?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried out, her cheeks glowing with a\\r\\nsuffusion of underlying crimson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot when he lies down under it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flashed at him a look resentful of his complacency. It held, too,\\r\\nfor the first time a critical doubt. There was plenty to like about\\r\\nJustin Merrick, and perhaps there was more to admire. He got things\\r\\ndone because he was so virile, so dominant. To look at the lines and\\r\\nmovements of his sturdy body, at the close-lipped mouth and resolute\\r\\neyes, was to know him a leader of men. But now a treasonable thought\\r\\nhad wirelessed itself into her brain. Had he a mind that never ranged\\r\\nout of well-defined pastures, that was quite content with the social\\r\\nand economic arrangement of the world? Did there move in it only a\\r\\ntight little set of orthodox ideas?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you know he lies down under it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked with spirit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do\\r\\nwe know what he has to contend with? Or how he struggles against it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf his open smile was not an apology, it refused, anyhow, to be at\\r\\nvariance with her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe so. As you say, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see him and you did.\\r\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let it go at that and hope he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you think he is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty, a little ashamed of her vagrant thoughts, tried to find a\\r\\ncommon ground upon which they could stand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think that men\\r\\nare often the victims of circumstance--that they get caught in currents\\r\\nthat kinda sweep them away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I am the captain of my soul,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he quoted sententiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, _you_ are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she admitted, after one swift glance that took in the\\r\\ndogged, flinty quality of him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut most of us aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Take Dad. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstrong, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four-square. But he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have gone as far as he\\r\\ndid with these tramps if he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got carried away. Well, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nthink maybe this boy is a victim of \\xe2\\x80\\x98the bludgeonings of chance\\xe2\\x80\\x99? He\\r\\nlooked like it to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe make ourselves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he insisted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the things we buck up against\\r\\nbreak us, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re weak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protest died away. She was not convinced, and\\r\\nshe made another start. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me that when I read the new\\r\\nnovelists--Wells, Galsworthy, or Bennett, say--one of the things I get\\r\\nout of them is that we _are_ modified by our environment, not only\\r\\nchanged by it, but sometimes made the prey of it and destroyed by it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDepends on how solid on our feet we are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered the engineer.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the plea of the agitator, I know. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always wanting to do\\r\\nimpossible things by law or by a social upheaval. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to\\r\\nit. A man succeeds if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strong. He fails if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis creed of the individualist was sometimes Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own, but\\r\\nto-night she was not ready to accept it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would be all very well\\r\\nif we all started equal. But we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. What about a man who develops\\r\\ntuberculosis, say, just when he is getting going? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weak, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nno fault of his.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may or may not be. Anyhow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his misfortune. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the\\r\\nworld over because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s come a cropper. Take this young tramp of yours.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to try him out and show you whether there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anything to him.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d put him on the work and let him find his level. Chances are he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\ndrift back to the road inside of a week. When a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down-and-out, it\\r\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t because he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a chance, but because of some weakness in\\r\\nhimself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty knew that in the case of many this was true. For a year or more\\r\\nshe had been an employer of labor herself. One of the things that had\\r\\nimpressed her among the young fellows who worked for her was that they\\r\\ndid find their level. The unskilled, shiftless, and less reliable were\\r\\ndropped when work became slack. The intelligent and energetic won\\r\\npromotion for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she did not believe that it was by any means a universal truth.\\r\\nMen were not machines, after all. They were human beings. However, she\\r\\ndropped the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone, so you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a chance to prove your case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me about the work. How is it going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sweetwater Dam project had been initiated to water what was known\\r\\nas the Flat Tops, a mesa that stretched from the edge of the valley to\\r\\nthe foothills. It had been and still was being bitterly opposed by some\\r\\nof the cattlemen of Paradise Valley because its purpose was to reclaim\\r\\nfor farming a large territory over which cattle had hitherto ranged at\\r\\nwill. Their contention held nothing of novelty. It had been argued all\\r\\nover the West ever since the first nesters came in to dispute with the\\r\\ncattle barons the possession of the grazing lands. A hundred districts\\r\\nin a dozen States had heard the claim that this was a cattle country,\\r\\nunfit for farming and intensive settlement. Many of them had seen it\\r\\ndisproved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposition of powerful ranching interests had not deterred Justin\\r\\nMerrick. Threats did not disturb him. He set his square jaw and pushed\\r\\nforward to the accomplishment of his purpose. As he rode or drove\\r\\nthrough the valley, he knew that he was watched with hostile eyes by\\r\\nreckless cowpunchers who knew that his success would put a period to\\r\\nthe occupation they followed. Two of them had tried to pick a quarrel\\r\\nwith him at Wild Horse on one occasion, and had weakened before his\\r\\ncool and impassive fearlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he did not deceive himself. At any hour the anger of these men\\r\\nmight flare out against him in explosive action. For the first time in\\r\\nhis life he was carrying a revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nClint Reed was a stockholder and a backer of the irrigation project. He\\r\\nowned several thousand acres on the Flat Tops, and it was largely on\\r\\naccount of his energy that capital had undertaken the reclamation of\\r\\nthe dry mesa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head and front of the opposition was Jake Prowers, who had brought\\r\\ndown from early days an unsavory reputation that rumor said he more\\r\\nthan deserved. Strange stories were whispered about this mild-mannered\\r\\nlittle man with the falsetto voice and the skim-milk eyes. One of them\\r\\nwas that he had murdered from ambush the successful wooer of the girl\\r\\nhe wanted, that the whole countryside accepted the circumstantial\\r\\nevidence as true, and in spite of this he had married the young widow\\r\\nwithin a year and buried her inside of two. Nesters in the hills near\\r\\nhis ranch had disappeared and never been seen again. Word passed as on\\r\\nthe breath of the winds that Prowers had dry-gulched them. Old-timers\\r\\nstill lived who had seen him fight a duel with two desperadoes on the\\r\\nmain street of Wild Horse. He had been carried to the nearest house\\r\\non a shutter with three bullets in him, but the two bad men had been\\r\\nburied next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two most important ranchmen in the valley were Clint Reed and\\r\\nJake Prowers. They never had been friendly. Usually they were opposed\\r\\nto each other on any public question that arose. Each was the leader\\r\\nof his faction. On politics they differed. Clint was a Republican,\\r\\nJake a Democrat. There had been times when they had come close to\\r\\nopen hostilities. The rivalry between them had deepened to hatred on\\r\\nthe part of Prowers. When Reed announced through the local paper the\\r\\ninception of the Sweetwater Dam project, his enemy had sworn that it\\r\\nshould never go through while he was alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHitherto Prowers had made no move, but everybody in the district knew\\r\\nthat he was biding his time. Competent engineers of the Government had\\r\\npassed adversely on this irrigation project. They had decided water\\r\\ncould not be brought down from the hills to the Flat Tops. Jake had\\r\\nseen the surveys and believed them to be correct. He was willing that\\r\\nReed and the capitalists he had interested should waste their money on\\r\\na fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream. If Justin Merrick was right--if he could bring water\\r\\nthrough Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on to the Flat Tops--it would be time enough for\\r\\nProwers to strike. Knowing the man as he did, Clint Reed had no doubt\\r\\nthat, if it became necessary in order to defeat the project, his enemy\\r\\nwould move ruthlessly and without scruple. It was by his advice that\\r\\nJustin Merrick kept the dam guarded at night and carried a revolver\\r\\nwith him when he drove over or tramped across the hills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nUNDER FIRE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day the faint far whir of the reaper could have been heard from the\\r\\nhouse of the Diamond Bar K ranch. The last of the fields had been cut.\\r\\nMuch of the grain had been gathered and was ready for the thresher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crop was good. Prices would be fair. Clint Reed rode over the\\r\\nfields with the sense of satisfaction it always gave him to see\\r\\ngathered the fruits of the earth. His pleasure in harvesting or in\\r\\nrounding-up beef steers was not only that of the seller looking to his\\r\\nprofit. Back of this was the spiritual gratification of having been\\r\\na factor in supplying the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs. To look at rippling wheat\\r\\nripening under the sun, to feed the thresher while the fan scattered\\r\\na cloud of chaff and the grain dropped into the sacks waiting for it,\\r\\nministered to his mental well-being by justifying his existence. He\\r\\nhad converted hundreds of acres of desert into fertile farm land. All\\r\\nhis life he had been a producer of essentials for mankind. He found in\\r\\nthis, as many farmers do, a source of content. He was paying his way in\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day Reed found the need of vindication. He was fonder of Betty than\\r\\nhe was of anything or anybody else in the world, and he knew that he\\r\\nwas at the bar of her judgment. She did not approve of what he had\\r\\ndone. This would not have troubled him greatly if he had been sure that\\r\\nhe approved of it himself. But like many willful men he sometimes had\\r\\nhis bad quarter of an hour afterward.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was easy enough to make excuses. The Diamond Bar K had been troubled\\r\\na good deal by vagrants on the transcontinental route. They had robbed\\r\\nthe smokehouse only a few weeks before. A gang of them had raided the\\r\\nwatermelon patch, cut open dozens of green melons, and departed with\\r\\nsuch ripe ones as they could find. Naturally he had been provoked\\r\\nagainst the whole breed of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had been too hasty in dealing with the young scamp he had\\r\\nthrashed. Clint writhed under an intolerable sense of debt. The boy\\r\\nhad fought him as long as he could stand and take it. He had gone\\r\\naway still defiant, and had rescued Betty from a dangerous situation.\\r\\nDragged back at a rope\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end to the ranch by the luckless Dusty, he had\\r\\nscornfully departed before Reed had a chance to straighten out with him\\r\\nthis added indignity. The owner of the Diamond Bar K felt frustrated,\\r\\nas though the vagabond had had the best of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not even sure that the severe punishment he had meted out to the\\r\\nother tramps had been wise. The man Cig had endured the ordeal unbroken\\r\\nin spirit. His last words before he crept away had been a threat of\\r\\nreprisal. The fellow was dangerous. Clint read it in his eyes. He had\\r\\ngiven orders to Betty not to leave the ranch for the next day or two\\r\\nwithout an escort. Yet he still felt uneasy, as though the end of the\\r\\nmatter had not come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now thirty hours since he had last seen the hoboes. No doubt\\r\\nthey were hundreds of miles away by this time and with every click of\\r\\nthe car wheels getting farther from the ranch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode back to the stable, unsaddled, and walked to the house. Betty\\r\\nwas in the living-room at the piano. She finished the piece, swung\\r\\nround on the stool, and smiled at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverything fine and dandy, Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face cleared. It was her way of telling him that she was ready to\\r\\nforgive and be forgiven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then, abruptly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReckon I get off wrong foot first sometimes,\\r\\nhoney.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in a big armchair. She went over to him, sat down on his knees,\\r\\nand kissed him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99S all right, Dad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she nodded with an effect of\\r\\nboyish brusqueness. Betty, too, had a mental postscript and expressed\\r\\nit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that boy. Nothing to do about it, of course. He wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let\\r\\nme do a thing for him, but--Oh, well, I just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get him off my mind.\\r\\nKinda silly of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot silly at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demurred Clint. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFeel that way myself--only more\\r\\nso.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He cleared his throat for a confession. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFact is, Bess, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmanaged to put me in a hole. Or else I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put myself there. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that\\r\\ninfernal quick temper of mine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d no business to let myself go. Of\\r\\ncourse, I was figurin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 him just a bum like the others, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for that\\r\\nmatter he is a tramp--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe quoted Shakespeare at me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inserted Betty, by way of comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no ignorant fool. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that. What was it he\\r\\ncalled me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The ranchman smiled ruefully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA local God Almighty on tin\\r\\nwheels! Maybe I do act like one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smile that went with the word robbed her concurrence of its sting.\\r\\nIt was tender and understanding, expressed the world-old superiority\\r\\nof her sex over the blundering male who had always claimed mastership.\\r\\nThere were times when Betty was a mother to her father, times when\\r\\nClint marveled at the wisdom that had found lodgment in the soft young\\r\\nbody of this vivid creature who was heritor of his life and yet seemed\\r\\nso strangely and wonderfully alien to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoint is that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t measure up to my chance and he did,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reed went\\r\\non gloomily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t set well with me, honey. After I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d thrashed him\\r\\ntill he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand, he goes right away an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fights for you because\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a woman. Makes me look pretty small, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to take\\r\\nhim by the hand and tell him so. But he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it that way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ngot to play my cards the way he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dealt \\xe2\\x80\\x99em. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I blame him,\\r\\neither.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, he had a right to refuse to have anything more to do with us after\\r\\nthe way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d treated him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMostly we get second chances in this life, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always, Bess.\\r\\nOh, well, no use crying over spilt milk. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry, Dad. I did my best to get him to\\r\\nstay--went down on my knees almost. But he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something\\r\\nqueer about him. What is it? He acts as though he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care what\\r\\nbecomes of him, as though he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s let go somehow. Did you notice that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoing to the devil fast as he can, looked like to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was probably accurate enough as a summary, but it did not explain\\r\\nwhy to Betty. She dismissed the subject for the moment, because Ruth\\r\\ncame into the room followed by Bridget.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child was in her nightgown and had come to kiss them before going\\r\\nto bed. She ran to her father, threw her arms around his neck, and gave\\r\\nhim a great bear hug. Long since she had forgotten his harshness of the\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had neither forgotten nor forgiven himself. In the first place,\\r\\nhe had been unjust. The injunction against going to the barn had not\\r\\nbeen a blanket one. It had applied only to that part of the building\\r\\nwhere the blooded stallion was kept in a box stall. He had hurt her\\r\\nfeelings as a vent to his annoyance at what had taken place by the\\r\\ncreek a half-hour earlier. It was pretty small business, he admitted,\\r\\nto take out his self-disgust on an innocent four-year-old.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held Ruth close in his arms while Bridget waited smilingly and the\\r\\nlittle one confided to him plans about the puppies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99N\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna have Lon make me a wagon, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll drive it jus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like\\r\\nBetty does the team, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I fink I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call the puppies Prince \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rover\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Baby Fifi \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99--\\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 everyfing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she concluded all in a breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be bully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the father agreed, stroking the soft flaxen curls\\r\\nfondly. He wondered reproachfully why it was that he could turn on\\r\\nthose he loved, as he had done on the child this morning. He had never\\r\\ndone it before with Ruth, and he resolved he never would again.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth kissed Betty good-night and went out of the room in the arms of\\r\\nBridget, held close to her ample bosom, kicking and squealing with\\r\\ndelight because she was being tickled in the ribs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Betty was in her own room, alone with her thoughts and the\\r\\nrest of the world shut out, her mind went back to the problem of the\\r\\nboy who had so early made such shipwreck of his life. She puzzled\\r\\nover this while she was preparing for bed and afterward while she\\r\\nlay between the white sheets, barred squares from the window frames\\r\\ncheckering the moonlight on the linen. What in the world could cause a\\r\\nman, educated, clean-fibered, strong, to let go of life like that?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could not be a woman. In spite of her youth, she knew this by\\r\\ninstinct. A game man did not give up because of blows dealt to him\\r\\nfrom the outside. The surrender had to come from within. No wounds at\\r\\nthe hands of another can subdue the indomitable soul. Young though\\r\\nshe was, she knew that. Books of fiction might say the contrary,\\r\\nbut she had a sure conviction they were wrong. What was it Browning\\r\\nsaid?--\\xe2\\x80\\x9c...Incentives come from the soul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Well, the converse of\\r\\nit must also be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere in this boy--she persisted in thinking of him as a boy,\\r\\nperhaps because his great need so filled her with the desire to help\\r\\nhim--there must be a weak strain. It was not, could not be, a vile one.\\r\\nShe held to that steadily and surely, without any of the passionate\\r\\ninsistence that doubt engenders. Ragged and dusty though he was\\r\\nphysically, on the drift to destruction, cynically self-condemned, he\\r\\nwas yet essentially clean and fine, a strain of the thoroughbred in\\r\\nhim. That was her judgment, and she was prepared to wager all she had\\r\\non the truth of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty did not sleep. Thoughts drifted through her mind as fleecy\\r\\nclouds do across a summer sky. The magnet of them was this youth who\\r\\nhad already drunk so deeply of life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bitterness. He extraordinarily\\r\\nstimulated her interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must have been near midnight that she heard quick voices and\\r\\nlifted her head to the cry of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFire!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sketchily she dressed and ran\\r\\ndownstairs. The blaze was in the lower meadow where the wheat was\\r\\ngathered for the thresher. A great flame leaped skyward and filled the\\r\\nnight with its reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the men from the bunkhouse was running toward the unpent\\r\\nfurnace. She caught up a saddle blanket from the porch and followed. In\\r\\nthe lurid murk figures like marionettes moved to and fro. As she ran,\\r\\nshe saw that there were three fires, not only one. This surprised her,\\r\\nfor the distance between two of them was at least one hundred and fifty\\r\\nyards. It was strange that in this windless night a spark had traveled\\r\\nso far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roar of the conflagration reminded her of some huge living monster\\r\\nin a fury. Tongues of flame shot heavenward in vain menace to the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStand back!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Forbes shouted at her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll we can do is see it don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nspread.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was flailing at a line of fire beginning to run in the dry\\r\\nstubble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did it start?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFire-bugs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean--on purpose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tramps?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 who.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He shouted to make his voice heard above the\\r\\ncrackle of the bellowing red demon that had been set loose. Already he\\r\\nspoke hoarsely from a throat roughened by smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she called back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen him since I left the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dusty gave\\r\\ninformation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaw him runnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 toward the creek awhile ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost instantly Betty knew why. He, too, must have guessed that this\\r\\nfire had come from no chance spark, but of set design. No doubt he was\\r\\ntrying to head off the incendiary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust which way?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked the cowpuncher.\\r\\n\\r\\nDusty jerked a thumb to the left. The girl turned and moved swiftly in\\r\\nthe direction of the fringe of bushes that rose as a vague line out\\r\\nof the darkness. She believed her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instinct was true. Whoever\\r\\nhad fired the stacks would retreat to the willows and make his escape\\r\\nalong the creek bed, hiding in the bushes if the pursuit grew close.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore she had taken a dozen steps a sound leaped into the night. It\\r\\nwas a revolver shot. Fear choked her. She began to run, her heart\\r\\nthrobbing like that of a half-grown wild rabbit in the hand. Faint\\r\\nfutile little cries broke from her throat. A sure intuition told her\\r\\nwhat she would find by the creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lay on a sand spit close to the willows. He was dragging\\r\\nhimself toward the cover of some brush. From the heavy foliage a shot\\r\\nrang out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty flew across the open to her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook out!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called sharply to her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the willows. Down here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nReed caught at her arm and pulled her behind him where he lay crouched.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe automatic of the man in ambush barked again. A spatter of sand\\r\\nstung Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face. Almost simultaneously came the bull roar of the\\r\\nforeman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hoarse voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re shot, Daddy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl whimpered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep still!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavy body crashed through the bushes in flight. At the same time\\r\\ncame the thump of running feet. Dusty broke into sight, followed by the\\r\\nforeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wounded rancher took command. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe went that way, boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nand pointed down the creek. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLit out a minute ago. Hustle back to the\\r\\nhouse and get guns, then cut down the road in the car and head him off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes nodded to Dusty. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do that. Take the boys with you. Hit the\\r\\ncreek at the ford and work up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He turned to his employer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow about\\r\\nit, Clint? Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99d he hit you? How bad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the leg. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll wait. You get him, Lon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman pushed into the willows and disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed called him back, but he paid no attention. The ranchman fumed.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the matter with the dawg-goned old idiot? No sense a-tall.\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way to do. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get shot first thing he knows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was so much his usual self that Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terror fell away\\r\\nfrom her. If he were wounded fatally, he would not act like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been hit just above the top of his laced boots. Betty uncovered\\r\\nthe wound and bathed it with water she brought from the creek in\\r\\nClint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hat. Around the wound she bound a large handkerchief she found\\r\\nin his hip pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes it hurt much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, her soft voice mothering him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome. Know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a leg. Lucky for me you came along. It must \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nscared him off. You an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Lon too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee who he was?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo dark.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink it was the tramps? Or Jake Prowers?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tramps. Not the way Jake pulls off a job. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no bungler.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down and put his head in her lap. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything else I can do, Dad?\\r\\nWant a drink?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed caught her little hand and pressed it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSho! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you go to\\r\\nworryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about me, sweetheart. Doc Rayburn, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fix me up good as\\r\\nnew. When Lon comes back I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have him--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped. A rough voice was speaking. A foot struck a stone. Vague\\r\\nfigures emerged from the gloom, took on distinctness. The big one was\\r\\nLon Forbes. He walked behind a man who was his prisoner, his great\\r\\nhands clamped to the fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty stood up and waited, her eyes fastened on them as they moved\\r\\nforward. Her heart was going like a triphammer. She knew what she\\r\\ndreaded, and presently that her apprehensions were justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prisoner was the tramp who called himself Tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cONE SQUARE GUY\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheeks the delicate wild-rose bloom had fled. Icy fingers\\r\\nseemed to clutch at her heart and squeeze the blood from it. This was\\r\\nthe worst that could happen, since she knew her father was not wounded\\r\\nto death.\\r\\n\\r\\nLon spoke, grimly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBumped into him down the creek a ways--hidin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in\\r\\nthe willows. Heard a rustling an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 drapped in on him onexpected. Thought\\r\\nhe wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come with me at first, then he changed his mind an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought\\r\\nhe would.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp said nothing. His dogged eyes passed from Betty to her\\r\\nfather. She thought there leaped into them a little flicker of surprise\\r\\nwhen they fell upon the ranchman sitting on the ground with his leg\\r\\nbound up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you taken his gun from him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reed asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it. He must \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 throwed it away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The foreman passed an\\r\\nexploring hand over the body of the prisoner to make sure that he had\\r\\nnot missed a concealed weapon. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. He ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got a gat with him\\r\\nnow, unless he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s et it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake him to the bunkhouse and keep him guarded. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll \\xe2\\x80\\x99phone for the\\r\\nsheriff. Soon as you get to the house call up Doc Rayburn and have him\\r\\nrun right out. Then hook up a team and come get me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ranch-owner\\r\\ndirected.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the fog of Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distress a small voice projected itself.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to send for the sheriff without making sure, Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure of what?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The steel-gray eyes were hard and cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure he did it. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t said so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laughter was harsh and without humor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNor he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t liable to.\\r\\nRight now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to fix up his alibi.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you going to hear what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe can tell it in court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty turned from him to the prisoner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you say something?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not get past the defense of his sardonic smile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall I\\r\\nsay?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell him you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she begged, seeking assurance for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould he believe me? Would you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came to her a conviction that she would--if he said it in a way\\r\\nto inspire confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe veil of irrision lifted from his eyes. He looked straight at her.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly Betty knew he was telling the truth. A warm resurgent wave\\r\\nflooded her veins. His life was bound up with tragedy. It had failed\\r\\nof all it had set out to be. But she knew, beyond doubt or evidence,\\r\\nthat he had not fired the stacks or shot her father. The amazing thing\\r\\nnow, to her mind, was that even for a moment she could have believed he\\r\\nwould kill at advantage in cold blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew it! I knew it all the time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did you know all that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no answer, yet it was as good as any she could give. How could\\r\\nshe phrase a feeling that rested only on faith in such a way as to give\\r\\nit weight to others?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 these Missouri guys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman snorted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to\\r\\nshow me. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 here? What was he hidin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out in the bushes\\r\\nfor? How could he tell soon as I jumped him that a man had been shot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe can explain that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she urged; and to the vagrant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re waiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snapped Reed, and voice and manner showed that he had\\r\\nprejudged the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man met his look with one of cold hostility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can keep on waiting--till the sheriff comes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuits me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snapped the ranchman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHustle along, Lon. No use wasting\\r\\ntime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman and his prisoner departed. Betty stayed with her father,\\r\\nmiserably conscious that she had failed to avert the clash of inimical\\r\\ntemperaments. None the less she was determined to keep the young man\\r\\nout of the hands of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began at once to lay siege to her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. I knew he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. It was that one they call\\r\\nCig. I know it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll three of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em in it likely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. They had quarreled. He wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in it with them. That Cig\\r\\nthought he had told you about his attacking me. He threatened this Tug.\\r\\nI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have shot him just as he did you--if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d got a chance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he did shoot me. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not been proved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if this one--the one they call Tug--if he did it, why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he\\r\\nhave a gun when Lon found him? Lon says he came on him unexpectedly. He\\r\\nhad no time to get rid of it. Where is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe he dropped it while he was running.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe that, Dad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she scoffed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have\\r\\nstopped to pick it up. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see he had to have that gun--the man\\r\\nthat shot you did--to make sure of getting away? And when Lon found him\\r\\nhe would have killed Lon, too. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have had to do it--to save himself\\r\\nfrom the hangman. The fact that this Tug didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a gun proves that\\r\\nhe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shoot you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, then. Does it prove he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in cahoots with the man\\r\\nwho did? What was he hiding here on the ground for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give him a chance to tell. He was ready to, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d let\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI asked him, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Dad, you know how you asked him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she reproached. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got his\\r\\npride, same as we have. If he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in this--and I know he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t--you\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame him for getting stubborn when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s badgered. His\\r\\nexplanations would have tumbled out fast enough if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been guilty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis struck Reed as psychologically true. The fellow had not acted like\\r\\na guilty man. He had held his head high, with a scornful and almost\\r\\nindifferent pride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did I say, for him to get his back up so quick?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ranchman\\r\\ngrumbled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way you said it, and the way Lon acted. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quick-tempered,\\r\\nand of course he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fed up with our treatment of him. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat right has he to travel with a bunch of crooks if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nexpect to be classed as one?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, he hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty put her arms round his neck with a warm rush\\r\\nof feeling. Motives are usually mixed in the most simple of us. Perhaps\\r\\nin the back of her mind there was an intuition that the road to her\\r\\ndesire lay through affection and not argument. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t row with you\\r\\nnow, Daddikins, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wounded and hurt. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so worried about you.\\r\\nI thought--a while ago--when I saw you lying on the ground and that\\r\\nmurderer shooting at you--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped, to steady a voice grown tremulous in spite of herself. He\\r\\nstroked her black hair softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know, li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 girl. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right now. Just a clean flesh wound.\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you feel bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he comforted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then that boy. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want us to rush into doing anything that\\r\\nwill hurt the poor fellow more. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done enough to him. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d feel\\r\\nawf\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly bad if we got him into trouble and he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the right man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed surrendered, largely because her argument was just, but partly,\\r\\ntoo, because of her distress. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave it your own way, Bess. I know\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to, anyhow. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear his story. If it sounds reasonable,\\r\\nwhy--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer arms tightened in a quick hug and her soft cheek pressed against\\r\\nhis rough one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all I want, Dad. I know Clint Reed. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\r\\nDusty calls one square guy. If you listen to this tramp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nget justice, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all I ask for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She dismissed the subject,\\r\\nsure in her young, instinctive wisdom that she had said enough and that\\r\\nmore would be too much. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs the leg throbbing, Daddy? Shall I run down\\r\\nto the creek and get water to bathe it? Maybe that would help the pain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, you stay right here where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dark and quit talking. The boys\\r\\nmay drive that fellow back up the creek. My leg\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be all right till\\r\\nRayburn sees it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come back here again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, her voice a-tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot if he can help it, you can bet on that. But if the boys hem him\\r\\nin, and he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break through, why, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to back-track.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart began to flutter again. She had plenty of native\\r\\ncourage, but to lie in the darkness of the night in fear of an assassin\\r\\nshook her nerves. What would he do if he came back, hard-pressed by the\\r\\nmen, and found her father lying wounded and defenseless? In imagination\\r\\nshe saw again the horrible menace of his twisted face, the lifted lip\\r\\nso feral, the wolfish, hungry eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould Lon Forbes never come back? What was he doing? What was keeping\\r\\nhim so long? He had had time long since to have reached the house and\\r\\nhitched a team. Maybe he was wasting precious minutes at the telephone\\r\\ntrying to get the sheriff.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dry twig crackled in the willows and Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand clutched\\r\\nspasmodically at her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm. She felt rather than saw his body\\r\\ngrow taut. There came a sound of something gliding through the saplings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty scarce dared breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\nA patter of light feet was heard. Clint laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA rabbit. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it could be any one in the willows. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nheard him coming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whispered Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rumble of wagon wheels going over disintegrated quartz drifted to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently they heard his voice talking to the horses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet over there,\\r\\nBuckskin, you got plenty o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 room. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eatin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you, anyhow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes stopped on the bluff and came down. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeft the fellow with\\r\\nBurwell tied up in the bunkhouse. Got both the sheriff and Doc Rayburn.\\r\\nHow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the leg, Clint?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed grunted a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99S all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and showed the foreman how to support\\r\\nhim up the incline to the wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes later they were moving back toward the ranch house. The\\r\\nfired stacks had burned themselves out, but smoke still rolled skyward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s watchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to see everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Forbes said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim to take chances till we get the whole crop threshed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 been worse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clint said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99d known how to go\\r\\nat it, he could have sent half the crop up in smoke. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lucky, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nsay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLuckier than he is. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bet he gets ten years,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman said with\\r\\nunction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither father nor daughter made any answer to that prophecy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NE\\xe2\\x80\\x99ER-DO-WELL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTug walked to the bunkhouse beside the foreman, the latter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fingers\\r\\nfastened like steel bands to his wrist. If Forbes said anything to his\\r\\nprisoner during the tramp through the wheatfield, the young fellow\\r\\nscarcely heard it. His mind was full of the girl who had defended him.\\r\\nIn imagination she still stood before him, slim, straight, so vitally\\r\\nalive, her dark eyes begging him to deny the charge that had been made\\r\\nagainst him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe low voice rang in his brain. He could hear the throb in it when\\r\\nshe had cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell him you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the joyous lift of her\\r\\nconfident \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew it--I knew it all the time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vagrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life was insolvent in all those assets of friendship that\\r\\nhad once enriched it. He had deliberately bankrupted himself of them\\r\\nwhen he had buried his identity in that of the hobo Tug, driven to it\\r\\nby the shame of his swift declension. It had been many months since any\\r\\nwoman had clung so obstinately to a belief in him regardless of facts.\\r\\nHe had no immediate family, no mother or sister with an unshakable\\r\\nfaith that went to the heart of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this girl who had crossed his path--this girl with the wild-rose\\r\\ncolor, the sweetness that flashed so vividly in her smile, the\\r\\ndear wonder of youth in every glance and gesture--believed in him\\r\\nand continued to believe in spite of his churlish rejection of her\\r\\nfriendliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he was one of the lost legion, it was an evidence of the divine\\r\\nflame still flickering in him that his soul went out to meet the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbrave generosity. In his bosom was a warm glow. For the hour at least\\r\\nhe was strong. It seemed possible to slough the weakness that rode him\\r\\nlike an Old Man of the Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis free hand groped its way to an inner pocket and drew out a package\\r\\nwrapped in cotton cloth. A fling of his arm sent it into the stubble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded Forbes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThrowing away my gun and ammunition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the tramp answered, his sardonic\\r\\nmouth twitching.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy you anything to pull that funny stuff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled the\\r\\nforeman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got a gun to throw away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes turned the captured vagrant over to Burwell, one of the extra\\r\\nharvest hands, and left him at the bunkhouse while he went to telephone\\r\\nthe doctor and the sheriff.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a busy night at the Diamond Bar K. The foreman drove away and\\r\\npresently returned. Tug heard the voices of Betty and her father as\\r\\nthey moved toward the house. Some one chugged up to the house in a car\\r\\nwith one spark plug fouled or broken.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurwell went to the door of the bunkhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet \\xe2\\x80\\x99em, Dusty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the cowpuncher answered while he was loosening the plug.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, y\\xe2\\x80\\x99betcha, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get \\xe2\\x80\\x99em if this bird we done got caged didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nplay a lone hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Dusty drove away again, in a hurry to rejoin his companions.\\r\\nHe had come back to find out whether anything new had been discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman showed up in the doorway. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe boss wants to have a talk\\r\\nwith you, young fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty would have known without any explanation that the prisoner had\\r\\nno intention of running away. But Lon had no perception of this. He did\\r\\nnot release his grip until the tramp was in the living-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe owner of the Diamond Bar K lay on a lounge and Betty was hovering\\r\\nclose to him as nurses do in their ministrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed spoke at once. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get down to brass tacks, young man. Put your\\r\\ncards on the table if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the clear. Come through clean. What do\\r\\nyou know about this business?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The rancher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice was crisp, but not\\r\\nunfriendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug sensed at once a change in attitude toward him. He had come\\r\\nexpecting to be put through the third degree. It was possible that was\\r\\nbeing held in reserve for him. His mind moved cautiously to meet Reed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean come clean--confess?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCall it what you want to. You claim you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shoot me--that you\\r\\nweren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in to-night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job at all. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hear your alibi.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d care to tell it to us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty suggested gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vagrant looked at her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fire wheatfields and I\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shoot from ambush.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the wounded man said impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I left the ranch yesterday, I went to Wild Horse and camped\\r\\na mile or so out of town. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care to meet the fellows I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nbeen with. They blamed me for having them hauled back to the ranch\\r\\nhere--thought I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hurried back to squeal on them. But I was looking for\\r\\nwork and I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to run away from them. About noon I tramped it\\r\\ninto town to see about getting a job. I saw this Cig in a store. He was\\r\\nbuying a gun and ammunition for it. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see me, so I passed by.\\r\\nLater I went back to the store and made sure, by asking the clerk, that\\r\\nCig had bought the gun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty broke in eagerly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you thought he meant to kill Father. So\\r\\nyou followed him out here to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the tramp answered with an edge of cold anger in his\\r\\nvoice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have lifted a finger for your father. He brought it\\r\\non himself. He could look out for himself. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he did to\\r\\nCig yesterday afternoon, but I know it was plenty. What would he expect\\r\\nfrom a fellow like Cig after he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d treated him that way? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dangerous\\r\\nas a trapped wolf and just about as responsible morally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. Say I brought this fellow and his gun on me by giving him\\r\\nwhat was coming to him. What next?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Reed brusquely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get him out of my head. If I could have been sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nlimit his revenge to you and your foreman-- But that was just it. I\\r\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. He might lie in wait for your daughter, or he might kidnap\\r\\nher little sister if he got a chance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKidnap Ruthie?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl broke in, all the mother in her instantly\\r\\nalert. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that, would he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProbably not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He turned to her with the touch of deference in voice\\r\\nand manner so wholly lacking when he faced her father. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought of it\\r\\nbecause the other day we were talking of the Charley Ross case, and Cig\\r\\nhad a good deal to say about just how a kidnapping ought to be done.\\r\\nThe point is that I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust him, after what your people have\\r\\ndone to him, any more than I would a rattlesnake. His mind works that\\r\\nway--fills up with horrible ideas of getting even. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absolutely\\r\\nunmoral, far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been able to find out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you trailed him out here--on the off chance that he might hurt\\r\\nBetty or Ruth. Is that it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inquired the rancher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind my own business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the prisoner jeered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ninvited me forcibly to get off your land and stay off, but I had to\\r\\ncome trespassing again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo need to rub it in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d blurted Reed by way of apology. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got off\\r\\nwrong foot first with you. Not all my fault, though. You acted mighty\\r\\nfoolish yourself. Still, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a legitimate kick coming. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nadmit that. Sorry--if that does any good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not offer to shake hands. It was his judgment that this youth\\r\\nwith the somber eyes so ready to express bitter self-mockery did not\\r\\nwant to have anything more to do with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vagrant offered no comment. His white face did not soften or its\\r\\nrigidity relax. Clearly he would make no pact with the Diamond Bar K.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty asked a swift question, to bridge the silence left by his\\r\\nrejection of her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tentative acknowledgment of wrong. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did\\r\\nyou know when they were coming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come after dark, and probably to-night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He corrected\\r\\nhimself at once. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI oughtn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to say \\xe2\\x80\\x98they,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for I knew York wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ncome. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the nerve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dead right there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll we give him was a\\r\\nfirst-class chapping, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he howled like he was bein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 killed. That\\r\\nother guy, now, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one sure-enough bad actor, if you ask me, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngame.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I lay in the brush near their camp,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the gay-cat explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYork\\r\\nwent down to the railroad yards. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely riding the rods for\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99Frisco by this time. After dark Cig started this way and I followed.\\r\\nWhen he left the track, I trailed behind. The moon wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t up, and I\\r\\nlost him. I knew he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be far away, so I headed for the ranch,\\r\\nkeeping close to the creek. For a while I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see or hear anything\\r\\nmore of him. Just as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d made up my mind to strike for the house, the\\r\\nfires flamed up. I heard two or three shots, then some one went by me\\r\\non the run. Time for me to be going, I thought. Your Mr. Forbes was of\\r\\nanother opinion. He showed up just then and invited me to stay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool, shrewd eyes had not lifted from the tramp while he was\\r\\nmaking the explanation. He was convinced that he had been told the\\r\\ntruth. The man had come out to do a service for his children, which\\r\\nwas equivalent to one for Clint himself. Again he felt the sting of\\r\\nself-reproach at having played a poor part in this drama that had been\\r\\nflung into the calmness of their quiet round of existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlad Lon did find you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the wounded man responded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go the whole\\r\\nhog and tell you straight I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m right sorry for the way I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve treated\\r\\nyou. That makes twice you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come through for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not forget it,\\r\\nMr.----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He hesitated, waiting for the other to supply the name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99er-do-well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suggested the white-faced tramp, and on his face\\r\\nwas a grim, ironic smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed flushed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve a right to remind me of that if you want to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot the first time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a damned fool, and it likely won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the\\r\\nlast. But you can tie to this, young man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The steel-gray eyes seized\\r\\nthose of the hobo and held them fast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf ever there comes a time when\\r\\nyou need Clint Reed, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be here waiting. Send for him, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ncome. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a promise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill he bring along with him Dusty and Mr. Forbes and the rest of his\\r\\noutfit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug asked, a derisive flash in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay anything you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve a mind to. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not blame you if you hold hard\\r\\nfeelings. I would in your place. But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget the fact. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\r\\never in trouble, Betty and I are here waiting to be called on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl slipped her hand into her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and gave it a quick\\r\\nsqueeze. It told better than words how glad she was of the thing he was\\r\\ndoing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can count on that knock-out punch of yours, can I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the prisoner\\r\\nasked ironically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl came forward impulsively, a shell-pink flag fluttering in her\\r\\ncheeks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that way. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sorry--we truly are. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nlove to have you give us a chance to show you how we feel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hard lines on his face broke. An expression warm and tender\\r\\ntransformed it. He turned his back on the others and spoke for her ears\\r\\nalone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn angel from heaven couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do more for me than you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done, Miss\\r\\nReed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always remember it--always. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s any comfort for you to\\r\\nknow it, be sure one scamp will never forget the girl who out of her\\r\\ninfinite kindness stretched down a hand to him when he was sinking in\\r\\nthe mud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you take the hand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered, all eager desire to help.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a very strong one, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever so willing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took it, literally, and looked down at it where it lay in his. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ntaking it, you see. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame yourself if it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pull the scalawag\\r\\nout of the mire. _Facilis descensus Averni_, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs your trouble so far beyond help?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured, and in her eyes\\r\\nhe read the leap of her sweet and gallant soul toward him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. Surely there can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be any sorrow or distress that\\r\\nfriendship won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lighten. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let me in where you are--if you\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shut me out by freezing yourself up--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe honk of an automobile horn had drawn Forbes to the window, from\\r\\nwhich point of observation he was reporting progress to his employer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReckon it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the sheriff an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Doc Rayburn.... Yep. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 outa\\r\\nthe car an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He turned to Reed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about this fellow\\r\\nhere? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the play we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to Daniels?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat he came to warn us, but got here too late. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do the talking,\\r\\nLon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA fat little man with a medicine case in his hand bustled into the\\r\\nroom. At his heels moved a big blond cattleman whose faded blue eyes\\r\\nwere set in a face of brown leather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the trouble? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the trouble?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fumed the doctor. It was his\\r\\nhabit of mind and manner to effervesce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome tramps set fire to my wheat and shot me up, Doc. Nothing worth\\r\\nputting in the papers, I reckon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered the ranchman easily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see about that. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor said with his little\\r\\ntouch of pomposity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stripped his automobile gloves for action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIS THIS BIRD A PRISONER, OR AIN\\xe2\\x80\\x99T HE?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dr. Rayburn, with Betty and Forbes to wait upon him, made\\r\\npreparations to dress the wound, Sheriff Daniels listened to the story\\r\\nof the ranchman. The officer was a hard-headed Westerner who applied\\r\\ncommon sense to the business of maintaining law and order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like that tramp Cig did it, unless this young fellow is passing\\r\\nthe buck for an alibi,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Frank. This boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right. I thought at\\r\\nfirst he might be in it, but I know now he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. He helped my girl\\r\\nout of a hole yesterday--licked this Cig because he got fresh with\\r\\nBess. Even before that he had parted company with the other two. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ngo to barkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up the wrong tree if you suspect him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheriff looked at Tug. The vagrant was standing beside the piano\\r\\nglancing at the music piled on top of it. Ragged, dusty, and unshaven,\\r\\nhe was not a prepossessing youth. Livid and purple bruises ridged his\\r\\npallid cheeks. Daniels found in the face something not quite normal,\\r\\nand, since he was a clean outdoor man himself, an unhealthy variation\\r\\nfrom the usual stirred in him a slight feeling of distrust.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy yore way of it, Clint, you beat up this hobo here for trespassing\\r\\non yore land. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say from the looks of him you gave him a plenty. Does\\r\\nit look reasonable to you that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d trail the other hobo for miles to\\r\\nprotect you from him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot to protect me, Frank. He gave it to me straight it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for me.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99Seems he got to worryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about what this Cig might do to the children.\\r\\nThe fellow had been talkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about kidnapping and how easy it could be\\r\\npulled off. So this one--Tug he calls himself--followed Cig here. Looks\\r\\nreasonable to me. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ought to have seen him come at me\\r\\nwith his legs wobbling under him. Well, a game man doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make war on\\r\\nwomen and kids, does he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur kind of man doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not our kind. Looks to me like a\\r\\ndope fiend. Expect he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a lot of these anarchist ideas tramps are\\r\\ncarryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 around the country nowadays. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilty. What I\\r\\ndo say is that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not convinced he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innocent. Far as being game goes,\\r\\nthis other man Cig is game enough, too, by what you say. Stood the\\r\\ngaff, and then bawled you out, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game like a cornered wolf. I tell you this one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nan educated man gone wrong. At first I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get him right myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got him right now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sheriff asked, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFar as this business goes, I have. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll admit he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no cause to\\r\\nlike me, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a hunch he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s white.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather have facts than hunches.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe owner of the Diamond Bar K was a new convert to the opinion he\\r\\nwas giving voice to, and he was therefore a more eager advocate of\\r\\nit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at this from my point of view, Frank. I thrash him till he\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand, and he pays me back by lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out for Bess when she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in\\r\\ntrouble. One of my men hauls him back here at the end of a rope. He\\r\\nsettles that score by tramping five or six miles to help us again. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nbe a poor sort if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come through for him now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not push on my reins, Clint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the officer promised. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery\\r\\nlikely you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure not aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to make trouble for any\\r\\ninnocent man. This tramp of yours will have every chance in the world\\r\\nto show he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s straight. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not arrest him unless I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the goods on\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Rayburn, ready for business, came forward fussily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou quit\\r\\nexciting my patient, Sheriff. Quit it. And move on out of this\\r\\nsick-room. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any one here but Miss Bessie and Bridget and\\r\\nLon Forbes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheriff laughed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, Doc. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yore say-so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked out of the room, the vagrant by his side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I under arrest?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the latter asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not under arrest, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like yore word that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stick\\r\\naround till I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a chance to size this thing up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d fire wheat and shoot a man down from cover, what good would my\\r\\nword be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes swept up and down him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStill, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ask\\r\\nfor yore word. Reed believes in you. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reckon you did this job.\\r\\nWill you stay where I can reach you for a few days? I might need you as\\r\\na witness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheriff was surprised, not at the promise, but at the sense of\\r\\nreliance he put in it. It came to him that, if this young fellow\\r\\ngave his word, he would keep it at any cost. Since this was scarcely\\r\\nreasonable, he tried to reject the conviction. He recalled his court\\r\\nexperience in listening to witnesses. Some of the most convincing\\r\\nwere liars out of whole cloth, while honest ones with nothing to\\r\\nconceal were at times dragged sweating through a tangle of incompatible\\r\\nstatements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter go to the bunkhouse and wait there. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fix it with Forbes so\\r\\nyou can sleep there to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Daniels said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug walked to the bunkhouse and sat down on the porch. After a time\\r\\nthe car returned with the men. They had not been able to find any one\\r\\nhiding in the brush or hurrying to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels took charge of the man-hunt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tackle this job on\\r\\nhorseback, boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis fellow will make for the railroad.\\r\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll jump a train at a station or a water-tank if he can. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll patrol\\r\\nthe points where the cars stop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman came down to the bunkhouse. Evidently he had his orders.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoys, the sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in charge of this job now. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do as he says.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDusty spoke up. He and others had been looking with open and menacing\\r\\nsuspicion at the paroled prisoner. That young man sat on the porch,\\r\\nchair tipped back on two legs, smoking a cigarette with obvious\\r\\nindifference to their hostility. The coolness of his detachment from\\r\\nthe business of the hour was irritating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about this bird here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dusty wanted to know. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs he a prisoner,\\r\\nor ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes passed on further orders. He did it in a dry voice that refused\\r\\nresponsibility. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. The boss says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s under obligations to him\\r\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you boys will treat him right. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he means every word of it. I\\r\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advise none of you to get gay with--with our guest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow is the boss?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Burt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoc says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do fine if no complications occur.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got the right idea, Doc has,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Burwell grinned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlways leave\\r\\nyoreself an alibi. Operation successful, but patient shy of vitality.\\r\\nNo flowers, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way to talk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reproved Forbes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe old man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlying there on the chaste lounge chipper as a woodchuck in the garbage\\r\\nbarrel at a dude ranch. You got a consid\\xe2\\x80\\x99rable nerve to get funny about\\r\\nhim, Burwell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim for to get funny about him, but about the doc,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\napologized the harvest hand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like when I open my mouth I always\\r\\nput my foot in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou put more ham an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 aigs an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 flannel cakes in it than any guy I\\r\\never did see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d commented the foreman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI been watchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to see if all\\r\\nthat fuel wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mebbe steam you up for work, but I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed\\r\\nany results yet. Prob\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly you wear out all yore strength talkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nfoolishness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat had ought to hold you hitched for a while, Burwell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dusty\\r\\nchuckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, boys. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go. Get busy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sheriff ordered crisply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey poured out of the bunkhouse to get their horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nA JOB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty rose at daybreak and got Justin Merrick on the telephone. After\\r\\npreliminary greetings she asked a question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould it be convenient for you to come down this morning? There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsomething I want to talk over with you if you have time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make it convenient,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came the answer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything serious happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat tramp Cig came back last night to fire the wheat. He shot Father.\\r\\nNo, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not badly hurt, but--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be right down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like Merrick that he did not wait for breakfast. He was at the\\r\\nDiamond Bar K as soon as his car could bring him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty set out a breakfast for him in the dining-room and waited on him\\r\\nherself with the aid of Ruth, who trotted back and forth with honey,\\r\\nsyrup, and butter for his hot cakes. Miss Ruth was not exactly fond of\\r\\nMerrick. He did not give himself out enough. But she appreciated him.\\r\\nHe had some good ideas about bringing her candy, teddy bears, and dolls.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Betty had reassured her fianc\\xc3\\xa9 about Mr. Reed and answered such\\r\\nquestions as he put about the fire and the man-hunt, she came to the\\r\\nreal reason for asking him to call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about that young man who was with the tramps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou offered to give him work. I wish you would, Justin. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so\\r\\nreliable. It might be a great thing for him to be under you--the very\\r\\nthing he needs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick was not especially pleased at being chosen as the agent to\\r\\nreform a vagrant. He was a very busy man. Also, he had a theory that\\r\\nevery man must stand on his own feet. But he had made a promise. He did\\r\\nnot make many, but he always kept those he made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get this right, Beth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, smiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d put him\\r\\nto work and see what he had in him. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m willing to do that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be up\\r\\nto him to make good. No special favors or sympathy or anything of that\\r\\nsort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty met his smile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d find it very easy to waste\\r\\nany sympathy on this young man. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that kind. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give him\\r\\nwork, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you can do for him. Good of you, Justin. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not\\r\\nforget it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got him on my conscience, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid he ask for work? Will he take it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask us for it. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got his foolish pride.\\r\\nBut he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who you are. I mean--that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m friendly with you or\\r\\nanything. Mr. Daniels wants him to stay in the neighborhood for a few\\r\\ndays. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be glad to get a job with you if he felt you really\\r\\nneeded him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get a chance of one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Justin said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProbably I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put\\r\\nhim on specialized work. Did he mention what his trade is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look as though he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d had a trade. Maybe he was studying\\r\\nfor some profession.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. At the bunkhouse, maybe, or wandering about the place.\\r\\nShall I send for him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better meet him by chance and bring the thing up casually,\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that would be better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving finished breakfast, Merrick went out to run down his man. He\\r\\nfound presently a ragged young fellow sitting on the tongue of an old\\r\\nwagon puffing nervously at a cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer nodded a good-morning at him and stopped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so hot as\\r\\nyesterday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said by way of introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assented the ragged one gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that Sheriff Daniels wants you to stay around a few days.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in charge of the Sweetwater Dam irrigation project. We need men.\\r\\nWant a job?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one that suits me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered the tramp, eyeing Merrick\\r\\nungraciously. He recognized the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strength and force. Every line\\r\\nof him, every glance, every inflection of the voice helped to bear out\\r\\nthe impression of success he radiated. Clearly he was masterful and\\r\\ndominant, but the younger man did not like him less for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can you do? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your line?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an engineer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat kind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done more bridge-building than anything else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick looked him over more carefully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCollege man?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMassachusetts Tech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy name\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Merrick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger hesitated a fraction of a second. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can call me Jones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of my men quit yesterday. Would you care to take a try at it? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncement work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who had given his name as Jones was suffering the tortures of\\r\\nthe damned. He wanted a shot in the arm to lift him out of himself,\\r\\nand he had thrown away his supply of the drug. Just now everything else\\r\\nin the world was unimportant beside this ravenous craving that filled\\r\\nhis whole being.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just as soon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said without enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later he sat beside Merrick in the runabout. The car was\\r\\ntaking the stiff grade of the road which climbed the Flat Tops to the\\r\\nhills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nONE BAD HOMBRE MEETS ANOTHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Jake Prowers looked grimly down upon the Flat Tops from the Notch.\\r\\nHe could see the full stretch of the mesa and below it one end of\\r\\nParadise Valley. The windmill of the Diamond Bar K was shining in the\\r\\nsun, miles away, flinging out heliographic signals that conformed to no\\r\\nman-made code.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWonder how Clint is this mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a high, squeaky voice\\r\\nthat went congruously with the small, twisted figure and the wrinkled,\\r\\nleathery face.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis _fidus Achates_, Don Black, shifted in the saddle to ease himself\\r\\nand rested his weight on one stirrup. He was a black-bearded,\\r\\nfierce-looking man in blue overalls, faded flannel shirt, and\\r\\nrun-down-at-the-heel boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know he was sick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, chewing tobacco imperturbably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFellow shot him last night, by jiminy by jinks, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 set fire to his\\r\\nwheat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black shot one startled, questioning look at his employer.\\r\\n\\r\\nJake cackled with splenetic laughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you look at me\\r\\nthataway, Don. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a thing to do with it. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 done it, it\\r\\nwould \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 been done right. This fellow was a tramp, they say. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nget any consid\\xe2\\x80\\x99rable amount of the wheat an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get Clint.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFate had played a strange trick when it put the unscrupulous and\\r\\nrestless soul of a Lucifer in the warped body of Jake Prowers, when\\r\\nit expressed that soul through a thin, cracked voice and pale-blue,\\r\\nwashed-out eyes. To the casual observer he seemed one of life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nineffectives. Those who knew him best found reason to shudder at his\\r\\nmirthless laughter and his mild oaths, at the steady regard of his\\r\\nexpressionless gaze. They seemed somehow to stress by contrast the\\r\\nman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dark and ruthless soul. There were moments when from those cold\\r\\neyes flamed something sinister and blasting that chilled the blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack had been living for weeks at an out-of-the-way cabin in the\\r\\nhills. He was riding herd on a bunch of Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cattle feeding on the\\r\\nedge of the Government reservation. Consequently he had been out of the\\r\\nway of hearing the news of the community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat had this tramp got against Clint?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, firing accurately\\r\\nwith tobacco juice at the face of a flat rock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know how high-headed Clint is. He beat up a bunch of tramps an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\none came back to even up things. Last night he took a whirl at it. The\\r\\nfellow set fire to some wheat-stacks an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gunned Clint when he showed\\r\\nup, by the jumpin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Jehosaphat. But Clint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no invalid. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take right\\r\\nsmart killing, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 all he got was one pill in the leg. Trouble with\\r\\nmost of these here bad men is they ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t efficient. When you lay for\\r\\nClint, Don, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d advise you to spill about a pint of lead in him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man grinned with broken-toothed malevolence at his henchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim to lay for Clint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled Black. He was not a humorist\\r\\nand he never knew when Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jokes were loaded with dynamite.\\r\\n\\r\\nJake cackled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course not. Clint, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good citizen if he did\\r\\nkick you off\\xe2\\x80\\x99n the Diamond Bar K once. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thing like that\\r\\nbetween friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t claim him as any friend of mine. If you ask me, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too\\r\\ndawg-goned bossy--got to have everything his own way. But that ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I got any notion of layin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the brush for him. Not so any one\\r\\ncould notice it. If Clint lives till I bump him off, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sure be a\\r\\nMethuselah,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black answered sulkily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jeered the cattleman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell Clint to quit worryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nabout you--that you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got a thing against him. Everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lovely,\\r\\neven if he did kick you around some.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rider flushed darkly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 none about me, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\r\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say everything was lovely. I like him same as I do a wolf.\\r\\nBut all I ask is for him to let me alone. If he does that, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not\\r\\ntangle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the breeze there came to them from far to the left a faint booming.\\r\\nProwers looked toward the rocky escarpment back of which lay the big\\r\\ndam under construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wrinkled, leathery face told no tales. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStill blasting away on his\\r\\ndinged dam project. That fellow Merrick is either plumb fool or else we\\r\\nare. I got to find out which.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make water run uphill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the dark man commented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Don. But maybe he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do that. Maybe the Government\\r\\nengineers are wrong. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll admit that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look reasonable to me. They\\r\\nput it down in black and white--three of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em, one after another--that\\r\\nElk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on is higher at the far end than this dam site of his.\\r\\nThey dropped the scheme because it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feasible. Probably Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\none of these squirts that know it all. Still--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The sentence died out,\\r\\nbut the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts raced on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack desisted from chewing tobacco to hum a fragment of a song he had\\r\\ncherished twenty-five years.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery daisy in the dell\\r\\n  Knows my story, knows it well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nhe murmured tunelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he should be right, by jiminy by jinks--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers was talking to\\r\\nhimself. He let the conditional clause stand alone. Slowly the palm of\\r\\nhis hand rasped back and forth over a rough, unshaven chin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid they catch this tramp that shot up Clint?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot yet. Daniels is patrolling the railroad. If the fellow hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t made\\r\\nhis getaway on the night freight, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll likely get him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to\\r\\nstick to the railway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy has he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the rider inquired. He was watching a moving object among\\r\\nthe rocks below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to skip the country. He ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t acquainted here--knows nothing\\r\\nabout these hills. If he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taken by some rancher and turned\\r\\nover to Daniels, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d starve to death. Likely he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lying under cover\\r\\nsomewheres along the creek.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLikely he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d differed Black. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLikely he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ducked for the hills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHis gaze was still on the boulder field below. From its case beside the\\r\\nsaddle he drew a rifle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy would he do that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dunno why, except that a fellow on the dodge can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always choose the\\r\\nroad he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna travel. Any reward for this guy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard of any. Yore conscience joggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you to light out and hunt\\r\\nfor the man that shot up Clint, Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his employer probed derisively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to hunt far, Jake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the herder replied, a note of\\r\\ntriumph in the drawling voice. For once he had got the better of the\\r\\nboss in a verbal duel. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right down there among the rocks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown where?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barrel of the rifle pointed to a group of large boulders which, in\\r\\nprehistoric days, perhaps, had broken from the ledge above and rolled\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jake said after the pale-blue eyes had watched the\\r\\nspot steadily for several moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seen us, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lying hid. You keep him covered while I go down\\r\\nand collect him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers gave this consideration and vetoed the suggestion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, you\\r\\nstay here, Don, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go get him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s any reward--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you worry about that. There ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gonna be any reward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranchman swung down from the saddle and descended from the bluff by\\r\\nway of a wooded gulch at the right. Ten minutes later, Black saw him\\r\\nemerge and begin to cross the rock slide toward the big boulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Prowers stopped and shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou fellow in the rocks, I\\r\\nwantta talk with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved cautiously a little closer, rifle ready for action. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got\\r\\nyou, fellow. Better come outa there an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 talk turkey. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim for\\r\\nto turn you over to the sheriff if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re anyways reasonable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWotcha want with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a voice called from the rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWantta have a pow-wow with you. Maybe you \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me can do business\\r\\ntogether. No can tell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cName\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jake Prowers. No friend of Clint Reed if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eatin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nyou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a delay of several seconds, a figure appeared and moved closer.\\r\\nThe ranchman saw in the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand the gleam of an automatic revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fugitive stopped a few yards from Prowers and eyed him\\r\\nsuspiciously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWotcha want to chew the rag about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nJake sat down on a rock with an air so casually careless that a\\r\\ntenderfoot might not have guessed that he was ready for instant action\\r\\nif need be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFellow, sit down,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got all day before us. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reckon\\r\\nyou got any engagements you have to keep immediate--not since you had\\r\\nthat one at the Diamond Bar K ranch last night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t getcha.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure you do. No use throwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a sandy with me. I tell you, fellow,\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m playin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 my own hand. Me, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like Reed any more\\xe2\\x80\\x99n you do. So,\\r\\nentrey noo, as the frog-eaters say, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take it for granted you were\\r\\nthe uninvited guest at Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ranch a few hours since. Yore work wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nfirst-class, if you ask old Jake Prowers. You didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burn but a small\\r\\npart of the wheat and you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get Clint anyways adequate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t croaked?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig demanded out of the corner of his\\r\\nmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, by jiminy by jinks. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know as that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nhelp you any when his boys catch you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gonna catch me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the New York crook boasted, his brain\\r\\nseething with suspicion of the dried-up little man in front of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nJake Prowers weighed this, a skeptical smile on his thin lips.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInteresting, but unreliable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he decided aloud, in regard to the\\r\\nother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prediction. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you aim to prevent it? The sheriff has\\r\\ngot you cut off from the railroad. Food don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow on bushes in these\\r\\nhills. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re done, unless--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou gotta \\xe2\\x80\\x99nother guess coming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the thug retorted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForget that\\r\\nstuff. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no hobo. Come to a showdown these country boobs\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find\\r\\nme right there with a gun. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a good man to lay off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Westerner laughed, softly and derisively. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFellow, you talk plumb\\r\\nfoolish. This ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t New York. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Colorado. That popgun of yours ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nworth a billy be damn. Why, I could pick you off right now an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 never\\r\\ntake a chance. Or my man could do it from the ledge up there. But say,\\r\\nfor the sake of argument, we let you go. Say you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found by any\\r\\nposse or cowpuncher. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of the trail you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re following? It\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lead anywhere but round an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 round in a circle. You got nothing\\r\\nto eat and no place to go for food. Maybe you can stick it out a week.\\r\\nThen you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI might get to a town and jump a freight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a chance. In a country like this news spreads in all directions.\\r\\nThere ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a man within fifty miles but has his eyes peeled for you.\\r\\nNo, sir, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in Dutch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig felt his helplessness, in spite of the bluff he was putting up.\\r\\nThis land of wide spaces, of a thousand hills and valleys, shook his\\r\\nconfidence. In New York he would have known what to do, but here he was\\r\\na child. The shrunken little man finished in brown leather was giving\\r\\nhim straight facts and he knew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing to that. Say, old Jonah, do I look like I had a yellow\\r\\nstreak?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the New York tough demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right. Suits me if it does you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jake rose and waved a hand airily\\r\\ninto space. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrift right along, my friend. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not keep you--not for\\r\\na minute. But when you come to the end of yore trail, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll remember\\r\\nthat you had one good bet you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t back because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re one of these\\r\\nwise guys that know it all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fugitive listened with sullen resentment. He did not want to\\r\\ntrust this old man. His instinct told him that, if he did so, Prowers\\r\\nwould be for the time at least his master. But he was driven by\\r\\ncircumstances which gave him no choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t said I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t listen to you, have I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he growled.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers sat down again on the rock. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I help you, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to come\\r\\nto an understanding right now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a business deal. I hide you an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nfeed you. Some day I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need you. When I do, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take orders like a\\r\\nlamb. If that ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agreeable to you, why, all you got to do is start\\r\\non yore travels now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeed me what for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded Cig.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the mild, skim-milk eyes of the cattleman there flashed for an\\r\\ninstant an expression of cold cruelty scarcely human. As Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thin\\r\\nlip smile met Cig, the tramp still felt the shock of that ruthless\\r\\nferocity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow the jumpin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Jehosaphat do I know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the old man said suavely,\\r\\nalmost in a murmur. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor murder, massacre, or mayhem. Not yore\\r\\nbusiness, my friend. All you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do is jump when I say so.\\r\\nUnderstand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig felt a cold sinking of the heart. He belonged to the dregs of\\r\\nhumanity, but he knew that this mild old man was his master in\\r\\nvillainy. It was as though he were smoking a cigarette with a keg of\\r\\ngunpowder scattered all around him. Jake Prowers was a center of danger\\r\\nalmost Olympic in possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dunno about that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the crook snarled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the wrinkled hand of the ranchman lifted in a gesture that\\r\\nincluded all space. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said ironically. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\npeace of the hills go with you while you hunt for a nice lonesome gulch\\r\\nas a coffin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do I get out of it if we do business? Or do youse figure on\\r\\nworkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me for a sucker?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJake had won, and he knew it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sense, my friend.\\r\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find me no tightwad. I pay for what I get, and I pay big.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d An\\r\\nominous flash of warning was in his eyes as he leaned forward and spoke\\r\\nslowly and softly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you throw me down--if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a finger crook\\r\\nabout you that ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t on the level with me--better say yore prayers\\r\\nbackward and forward. No man ever double-crossed Jake Prowers an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 got\\r\\naway with it. It ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t being done in this neck of the woods.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy villain though he was, Cig felt a shiver go down his spine. He\\r\\nwas superstitious, as all criminals are. He had the feeling that some\\r\\none was walking on his grave, that this wrinkled old devil had been\\r\\nappointed by fate to put a period to his evil ways and days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook off the wave of foreboding and slouched forward, slipping the\\r\\nautomatic into his coat pocket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll play square, boss, if you do. See\\r\\nme through an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go the limit for you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bargain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJake shook hands on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDone, by jiminy by jinks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in his high weak voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig was puzzled and a little annoyed. How had he ever been fooled into\\r\\nthinking that this inoffensive little specimen was dangerous? It was\\r\\nwritten on him that he would not hurt a fly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HOMESTEADER SERVES NOTICE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later years the man who had called himself Tug Jones looked back on\\r\\nthe days and nights that followed as a period of unmitigated dejection\\r\\nand horror. The craving for the drug was with him continually. If he\\r\\nhad had a supply on hand, he would have yielded a hundred times to the\\r\\ntemptation to use it. But he had burned the bridges behind him. There\\r\\nwas no way to get the stuff without going in person to a town of some\\r\\nsize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis meant not only a definite surrender of the will, but a promise\\r\\nof relief that could not be fulfilled inside of twenty-four hours at\\r\\nthe earliest. Just now this stretch of time was a period of torment as\\r\\nendless as a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow he stuck it out, though he spent much of his time in an inferno\\r\\nof feverish desire. He tried to kill the appetite with work. Merrick,\\r\\nmoving to and fro with a keen eye on the men, observed that the foreman\\r\\nwas sloughing his work and letting it fall on Jones. At the end of the\\r\\nweek, Merrick discharged him and raised the former tramp to his place\\r\\nas foreman. Jones accepted the promotion without thanks. He knew he had\\r\\nearned it, but he did not care whether he received it or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grew worn and haggard. Dark shadows emphasized the hollows of the\\r\\ntortured eyes. So irritable was his temper that at a word it flashed to\\r\\nexplosion. By disposition he was not one to pass on to subordinates the\\r\\nacerbity that was a residue of the storm that was shaking him. A sense\\r\\nof justice had always been strong in him. Fifty times a day he clamped\\r\\nhis teeth to keep back the biting phrase. In general he succeeded, but\\r\\nmalingerers found him a hard taskmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey appealed to Merrick and got small comfort from him. The new cement\\r\\nforeman was getting the work done both rapidly and well. That was all\\r\\nthe chief engineer asked of him. The details could be arranged by Jones\\r\\nas he pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nights were the worst. During the day he had the work to occupy his\\r\\nmind, but when darkness fell over the hills its shadows crept over his\\r\\nsoul. He could not sleep. Sometimes he borrowed technical books from\\r\\nMerrick and tried to bury himself in study. More often he tramped till\\r\\nphysical exhaustion drove him back to his cot to stare up sleeplessly\\r\\nat the canvas roof of his tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuffering wears itself out at last. There came a time when the edge\\r\\nof the craving grew less keen, when its attack was less frequent. In\\r\\nthe pure, untempered air of the hills the cement gang foreman came to\\r\\nsounder health. His appetite increased with his physical stamina. One\\r\\nday it struck him with a little shock of surprise that he had not had\\r\\none of his racking headaches for two weeks. He began to sleep better,\\r\\nthough there were still nights when he had to tramp the hills in\\r\\nself-defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nInevitably during those days the foreman found himself studying the\\r\\nproject upon which Merrick had staked his reputation. As an engineer he\\r\\ntook off his hat to the efficiency with which his chief got results.\\r\\nMerrick was a driver, but he was more than that. He had the fighting\\r\\nspirit that lifts from defeat to victory. Good engineers had said it\\r\\nwas not feasible to water the Flat Tops by means of ditches carrying\\r\\nwater from the drainage area above. Justin Merrick had not accepted\\r\\ntheir verdict. He had made his own surveys and meant to demonstrate\\r\\nthat they were wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew that a certain group of cattlemen, under the leadership of\\r\\nold Jake Prowers, were watching him sullenly. They believed, from the\\r\\nsurveys made by Government engineers, that the grade made it impossible\\r\\nto bring water from the dam through Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on to the mesa below.\\r\\nYet Merrick knew, too, that they were uneasy. It was on the cards that\\r\\nthe Reclamation Service experts might be wrong in their surveys. If\\r\\nProwers discovered that they were, Justin felt sure he would move to\\r\\nruthless and dynamic action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe big dam was practically finished. Merrick kept a night guard over\\r\\nit and the tools. Sometimes, after supper, he strolled down to look it\\r\\nover and think out under the quiet stars the problems of supplies or\\r\\ncanal construction. It was on such a night visit that he came face to\\r\\nface with the new concrete work foreman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe superintendent of construction had been watching Tug Jones. He had\\r\\nfound out that the man was one who would accept responsibility and\\r\\ncould be trusted to get efficient results without supervision. Twice he\\r\\nhad taken him from the work he had in charge and given him engineering\\r\\ndifficulties to solve. Each time the man from Massachusetts Tech had\\r\\neliminated the tangle in the clearest and simplest way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick was not given to asking advice of his subordinates, no matter\\r\\nhow capable they might be. To-night he simply made an announcement of a\\r\\ndetail in his plans that involved the foreman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout time we began work on Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on, Jones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ngoing to put you in charge and run the ditch line through right away.\\r\\nWe may have trouble there. That fellow Prowers had one of his men, a\\r\\nrider named Don Black, file a homestead claim right in the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. It\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stick. He knows that, but he wants some ground to fight us. Look\\r\\nout for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed the foreman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe habit of mind of the Massachusetts Tech man was to be thorough. He\\r\\nstudied the surveys very closely and went over the ground carefully\\r\\nfrom the dam site to the ca\\xc3\\xb1on entrance. The conclusion was forced upon\\r\\nhim that Merrick had made a mistake. The grade through the hills to Elk\\r\\nCreek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on would not do. He could put his finger on the very spot that\\r\\nmade it impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was hard for him to believe that Merrick had made a blunder so\\r\\nvital to the success of the enterprise. He checked up his figures a\\r\\nsecond time and made a re-survey of that part of the line. There was no\\r\\npossible doubt about it. Since water will not run uphill by gravity, it\\r\\ncould not flow from the dam to the upper entrance of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reported to his chief what he had discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick took this facer with no least hint of dismay. So far as his\\r\\nstrong, square-cut visage gave any expression, it was one of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose you leave that to me, Jones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said curtly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ndoing. What I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m asking of you is to determine the best path for the\\r\\nditch along the side of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the water to the ca\\xc3\\xb1on--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my business. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not responsible for that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere remained nothing more to be said. Jones carried away with him\\r\\nthe knowledge that his chief had flatly declined to give weight to his\\r\\nfindings. He could either resign or he could do as he was told.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe younger man was puzzled. Was it possible that Merrick, after\\r\\nall, was a pig-headed four-flusher? That he could be a pretentious\\r\\nincompetent fed up with a sense of infallibility?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see him on the work was a refutal of this view. He was an egoist\\r\\nthrough and through. To look at the salient jaw, into the cool, flinty\\r\\neyes, was to recognize the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-sufficiency. He was dominant and\\r\\nmasterful. But it was hard to believe that his shrewd, direct, untiring\\r\\nenergy masked any incapacity. He did not seem to have the quality of\\r\\nmind that is content to fool itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug knew that his chief had a much wider experience in engineering than\\r\\nhe. This project must have been studied by him from every angle, all\\r\\ndifficulties considered, all technical problems solved. Yet the fact\\r\\nstood in the way like a Rock of Gibraltar that water flows downhill and\\r\\nnot up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders and stepped out from under. Merrick had told\\r\\nhim with cool finality that it was none of his business. That was true.\\r\\nHe had done his full duty when he reported the matter to the chief. He\\r\\nturned his attention to running the ditch line through the gorge.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo save time he moved his outfit to Elk Creek. A chuck wagon, mule\\r\\nteams, scrapers, and necessary supplies followed the little group of\\r\\nsurveyors. Within a week the sound of blasting echoed from wall to wall\\r\\nof the ravine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men rode up the defile to the engineer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camp one sunny morning.\\r\\nJones, in flannel shirt, corduroys, and high laced boots, directed\\r\\noperations as the workmen set out on the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the visitors to the camp was a long, black-bearded, fierce-eyed\\r\\nman in blue overalls. The other was a mild little fellow in years well\\r\\npast middle age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dark man introduced himself rudely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the blue blazes you doing\\r\\nhere? This is my homestead. You trying to jump my claim?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer met this brusque attack suavely. During the past weeks,\\r\\nas he had slowly fought his way back toward self-respect, the defiance\\r\\nand the bitter irony had disappeared from his manner. He was recovering\\r\\nthe poise that characterizes the really able man of affairs when he is\\r\\nsubjected to annoyance and worry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are Mr. Donald Black?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m him. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to say that no man--I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care if he is backed\\r\\nby a big corporation--can jump my property an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 get away with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we have any intention of prejudicing your rights, Mr.\\r\\nBlack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only an employee. Mr.\\r\\nMerrick is the man you ought to see. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find him up at the dam.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m servin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice on you right here an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 now to get off my land. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ngivin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you till night to get yore whole outfit outa here. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\na-going to see anybody. Understand? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got me in one word short an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsweet--git.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dried-up little man beside Black let out a cracked cackle of\\r\\nlaughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeems like that should ought to be plain enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nmurmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug looked at the wrinkled cattleman. He guessed that this was Jake\\r\\nProwers, of whose sinister reputation rumors had reached him. But it\\r\\nwas to Black he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think, perhaps, you had better see a lawyer? There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always\\r\\na legal way to straighten out difficulties that--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLawyer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exploded Black with an oath. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen, fellow! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim for\\r\\nto see no lawyer. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like fine to tie this up in the courts while\\r\\nyou went right on building yore end gates an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 runnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yore ditches on\\r\\nmy land. No, sir. Cattle was here first, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim to let you\\r\\nchase us off. See?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expect the law will have to decide that, Mr. Black. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmerely an opinion of mine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to run a ditch through this\\r\\nca\\xc3\\xb1on--an employee hired at so much a week. Unless I get orders to stop\\r\\nwork, the ditch will be dug.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jones spoke evenly, without raising his\\r\\nvoice, but there was a ring of finality in his tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou crow damn loud,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black retorted angrily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99 know who\\r\\nyou are--a good-for-nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tramp liable to go to the pen for burnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nup wheat an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bush-whackin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Clint Reed? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all swelled up, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou? Forget it, fellow. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m givin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you orders to clear out. If you\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, some of you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re liable to be sorry. This here is a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug looked straight at the rawboned, dark man. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked\\r\\npointedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers answered. He knew that enough had been said. More would be\\r\\nsurplusage and might carry the danger of a come-back in case men should\\r\\nbe killed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be sorry to beat a pore man outa his claim, wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, tee-heeing with virulent laughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on, Don. Might as well\\r\\nbe pushin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on our reins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOver his shoulder the homesteader flung a last word that might be taken\\r\\nas a threat, a warning, or a prophecy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTill to-night, Mr. Hobo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAMPEDE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJones sent a messenger to his chief with word of Don Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s threat,\\r\\nand Merrick at once rode to Elk Creek to consult with the man he had\\r\\nput in charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo they mean to attack you? Is that what you gathered from what he\\r\\nsaid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the chief engineer of his assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Prowers smoothed over what Black said. I judge he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwant to go on record as having made any threats. But the last thing the\\r\\nbig fellow yelled at me was that we had till to-night to get out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood of him to give you warning. What do you suggest, Jones?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive me half a dozen rifles and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hold the fort,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the younger man\\r\\nreplied, eyes gleaming. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDouble the gang and let me rush the work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a little private war we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nhaving. Think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just let you sit tight and see what happens. Prowers\\r\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t likely to go far to start with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuits me, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame me if they drive us out. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rather looking\\r\\nfor a bunch of armed cowboys to descend upon us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn which case you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll enter a formal protest and retire in good order\\r\\nwithout resistance. The law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with us. I filed our maps and plans with\\r\\nthe Land Office before Black homesteaded. He obviously took up this\\r\\nquarter section only to hamper us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill it delay you much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Merrick smiled, a rather peculiar smile that suggested a\\r\\nknowledge of facts not on the surface. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nno reason why Prowers shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather tame surrender, wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be? If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re within your rights,\\r\\nwhy not stand our ground and fight them off?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the moral effect, you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it a sign of weakness for us to hoist the white flag after\\r\\nthe first brush?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a point of view. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re playing for position. Let Prowers break\\r\\nthe law and get in wrong. If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re armed and looking for trouble, we\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come into court with clean hands ourselves. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather let him\\r\\nshow his plan of campaign. Even though we should be driven out, we can\\r\\ncome back whenever we want to. He can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep his men here and hold the\\r\\ngulch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. At least he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who had fought in Flanders was not satisfied. The irrigation\\r\\ncompany was in the right. Prowers and the group of men with him were\\r\\nobstructionists, trying to hold back the progress of the country for\\r\\ntheir own selfish ends. They were outside the law, though they were\\r\\nusing it as a cover. The policy to be expected of Merrick would have\\r\\nbeen bolder, less opportunistic. Why had the chief marched his men up\\r\\nthe hill, like the King of France in the rhyme, only to march them down\\r\\nagain? This did not seem to go well with his salient, fighting jaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it was his business to obey orders and not to ask for reasons,\\r\\nTug said no more. He understood that Merrick was holding back something\\r\\nfrom him, and he had no desire whatever to force a confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick rode back to the dam and left his subordinate in charge of\\r\\nthe camp. Throughout the day work went on uninterrupted. At dusk the\\r\\nsurveyors and ditch-diggers returned to the draw where the tents had\\r\\nbeen set. At this point of the gorge the wall fell back and a slope led\\r\\nto the rim above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the summit of this rise the engineer posted a sentry with orders to\\r\\nfire a revolver in case of an attack. Two other guards were set, one at\\r\\neach mouth of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. At the expiration of four hours, these were\\r\\nrelieved by relays. At midnight, and again in the chill pre-dawn hours,\\r\\nJones himself made a round of the posts to see that all was well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had scarcely lain down after the second tour when the crack of a\\r\\nrevolver sounded. Tug leaped to his feet and was drawing on a boot\\r\\nbefore the echoes had died away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he ducked out from the tent flap, revolver in hand, a glance showed\\r\\nhim scantily clad men spilling from their sleeping quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it? Where are they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some one yelled.\\r\\n\\r\\nA light breeze was stirring. On it was borne a faint rumble as of\\r\\nthunder. It persisted--seemed to be rolling nearer. The sound deepened\\r\\nto a steady roar. Tug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s startled glance swept the ca\\xc3\\xb1on sword cleft.\\r\\nCould there have been a cloudburst in the hills? The creek bed was\\r\\nstill dry. His eyes swung round to the saddle ridge of the draw above\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nA living tidal wave was pouring across the rim and down the draw.\\r\\nHundreds of backs tossed up and down like the swell of a troubled sea.\\r\\nThough he had never seen one before, the engineer knew that the camp\\r\\nwas in the path of a cattle stampede.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shouted a warning and raced for the higher ground at the edge of\\r\\nthe draw. The men scattered to escape from the path of that charging\\r\\navalanche. They were in a panic of fear. If any were caught beneath\\r\\nthe impact of those scores of galloping hoofs, they would be crushed\\r\\nto death instantly. Startled oaths and staccato shouts rang out. An\\r\\nanguished yell of terror lifted itself shrilly. A running man had\\r\\nstumbled and gone down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thud of the hoofs died away. The stampede had swept down into the\\r\\ndry bed of the stream and swung to the right. It left behind it a\\r\\ndevastated camp. Tents had been torn down and ripped to pieces. Cots\\r\\nwere smashed to kindling. From the overturned chuck wagon scattered\\r\\nfood lay trampled into the ground by sharp feet. The surveying\\r\\ninstruments were broken beyond repair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA huddled mass lay motionless in the track of the avalanche. Tug knelt\\r\\nbeside it and looked into the battered outline of what a few moments\\r\\nearlier had been a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face quick with life. No second glance was\\r\\nnecessary to see that the spirit had passed out of the crushed body.\\r\\nThe engineer recognized him by the clothes. His name was Coyle. He\\r\\nhad been a harmless old fellow of many quips and jests, one full of\\r\\nthe milk of human kindness. He, too, had fought against his weakness,\\r\\na fondness for liquor that had all his life kept him down. Now, in a\\r\\nmoment, his smiles and his battles were both ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nJones straightened the twisted body and the sprawling limbs before\\r\\nhe covered the face with a handkerchief. He rose and looked grimly\\r\\nround at the group of appalled men whose blanched faces made a\\r\\ngray semi-circle in the faint light of coming dawn. They were a\\r\\nrough-and-ready lot. Most of them had seen the lives of fellow workmen\\r\\nsnuffed out suddenly. But this had come like a bolt from heaven. Each\\r\\nof them knew that it might have been he lying there; that if the boss\\r\\nhad not set a watch, the stampede would have destroyed many of them.\\r\\nThe shock of it still chilled the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve murdered poor Coyle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer said, and his voice was a\\r\\nsolemn accusation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked one, startled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese cattle didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gather up there by themselves. They were rounded\\r\\nup and stampeded over the crest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJake Prowers!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed a mule-skinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll name no names yet, boys, not till we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put it up to Mr.\\r\\nMerrick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The camp boss glanced up the hill. The sound of some one\\r\\nrunning had reached his ears. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere comes Jensen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear what he\\r\\nhas to say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJensen confirmed the charge of the engineer. He had heard voices,\\r\\nshots, the crack of whips, and then the thundering rush of cattle. He\\r\\nhad fired once and fled for the safety of the rocks. The stampede had\\r\\nstormed past and down the slope. But he had seen and heard no more\\r\\nof the men who had been exciting the wild hill cattle to a panic of\\r\\nterror. They had disappeared in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer made arrangements for carrying the body of Coyle to the\\r\\ndam and sent a messenger to notify Merrick of what had taken place.\\r\\nThis done, he climbed to the saddle of the draw with the intention of\\r\\ninvestigating the lay of the land where the stampede had started. He\\r\\nknew that, if he were only expert enough to read it, the testimony\\r\\nwritten there would convict those who had done this crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt work of this sort he was a child. He was from the East, and he knew\\r\\nnothing of reading sign. Stamped in mud, with outlines clear-cut and\\r\\nsharp, he would have known, of course, a pony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tracks from those of a\\r\\nsteer. But unfortunately the marks imprinted on the short brittle grass\\r\\nwere faint and fragmentary. They told no story to Jones.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe quartered over the ground carefully, giving his whole mind to the\\r\\nopen page which Nature had spread before him and covered with her\\r\\nhandwriting. Concentration was not enough. It was written in a language\\r\\nof which he had not learned the vocabulary. Reluctantly he gave up the\\r\\nattempt. Sheriff Daniels was a Westerner, an old cattleman, skilled at\\r\\ncutting sign. This was a problem for him to solve if he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was afternoon when the sheriff arrived. He had made one discovery\\r\\nbefore reaching the camp. A cow had broken a leg in the stampede and\\r\\nlay helpless in the bed of Elk Creek. The brand on it was the Diamond\\r\\nBar K.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFine business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commented dryly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enemies try to bust up\\r\\nthe irrigation proposition he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interested in by stampedin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 his own\\r\\ncattle down the draw here. Maybe we can find out the _hombres_ that\\r\\nrounded up a bunch of his stock yesterday. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99d help some.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the sheriff discovered anything from his examination of the lane\\r\\nover which the stampede had swept, he did not confide in either Jones\\r\\nor Merrick. Like many men who have lived much in the open, he had a\\r\\ncapacity for reticence. He made his observations unhurriedly and rode\\r\\naway without returning to the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick gave his assistant orders to break camp and return to the dam.\\r\\nA force was still to continue at work in the ca\\xc3\\xb1on, but the men would\\r\\nbe taken up and brought back each day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS PICTURE IN THE PAPER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSummer had burned to autumn. The first frosts had crisped the foliage\\r\\nof the quaking asps and the cottonwoods to a golden glory in tune with\\r\\nthe halcyon Indian summer. Faint threats of coming winter could be read\\r\\nin an atmosphere grown more pale and sharp, in coloring less rich and\\r\\nwarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty could count the time in months now since she had sent her\\r\\nsalvaged tramp into the hills to help her lover wrestle with the\\r\\nproblems of the Sweetwater Dam project. It was still a joy to her that\\r\\nshe had been intuitively right about him. He was making good. He had\\r\\nbrains and ability and the power of initiative which marks the strong\\r\\nman from the subordinate. Justin admitted this generously, giving her\\r\\ncredit for a keener insight than his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was not the best of it. She knew now, through Merrick, what\\r\\nthe vice was that had dragged him down: and from the same source she\\r\\nlearned that he had so far fought his campaign out to victory. Not\\r\\nsince the day after her father had been shot had she seen the young\\r\\nman, but she wished she could send him a message of good cheer and\\r\\nfaith.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought of him a good deal. She was thinking of him this morning as\\r\\nshe cleaned the pantry shelves and substituted new papers for the old.\\r\\nJustin had been down the evening before and had told her of the threat\\r\\nProwers had made through Don Black in case the young engineer did not\\r\\nevacuate the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. It was in her character to look for good rather\\r\\nthan ill in men, but she had a conviction that the cackling little\\r\\ncattleman was a sink of iniquity. He would do evil without ruth. There\\r\\nwas, she felt, something demoniac, unhuman about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow far would he go to begin with? She did not know, but she was glad\\r\\nJustin had given orders to retire from Elk Creek in case of attack. His\\r\\nreasons she appreciated and approved. He was no hothead, but a cool,\\r\\nhard-hitting, determined fighter. In the end he would win, no matter\\r\\nwhat difficulties were thrown in his way. She could not think of Justin\\r\\nin any way except as a success. He was the kind of man who succeeds in\\r\\nwhatever he undertakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telephone rang. Her father, at Wild Horse, was on the line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been trouble at the ca\\xc3\\xb1on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been talkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nwith Daniels. Merrick has sent for him. A man was killed--some one\\r\\nworking on the job. Haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard any particulars yet. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let you\\r\\nknow if I do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKilled--on purpose, you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear who?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaniels doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty returned to her work very much disturbed in mind. There was no\\r\\nreason for assuming that the man who had been killed was her redeemed\\r\\nvagrant, but she could not get this possibility out of her mind. He\\r\\nwould be in the forefront of danger if there was any. She knew him well\\r\\nenough for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to get Merrick on the telephone, but the word that came\\r\\ndown to her from the dam was that he had ridden to Elk Creek. Did the\\r\\nassistant superintendent know when he would be back? No, he did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTremulously Betty asked another question. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you heard, Mr.\\r\\nAtchison, who the man is that was killed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis name\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Coyle--a man sent out to us by an employment agency in\\r\\nDenver.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty leaned against the wall a moment after she had hung up the\\r\\nreceiver. She was greatly relieved, and in the reaction from the strain\\r\\nunder which she had been holding herself tautly felt oddly weak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a goose!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told herself with stinging candor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does\\r\\nit matter to you who it was?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she knew it mattered a great deal. Nobody had ever stimulated\\r\\nher imagination as this tramp had. Her liking for Justin was of\\r\\nquite another sort. It had not in it the quality that set pulses\\r\\npounding. She would have denied to herself indignantly that she did\\r\\nnot love him. If not, why was she engaged to him? But her affection\\r\\nwas a well-ordered and not a disturbing force. This was as it should\\r\\nbe, according to her young philosophy. She gave herself with energy\\r\\nand enthusiasm to the many activities of life. The time had not yet\\r\\ncome when love was for her a racing current sweeping to its goal so\\r\\npowerfully that there could be no dalliance by the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty moved the dishes from the last shelf. As she started to gather\\r\\nthe soiled newspaper folded across the plank, her glance fell upon the\\r\\npicture of a soldier in uniform. The eyes that looked into hers were\\r\\nthose of the man who had called himself Tug Jones.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer breath caught as she read. The caption beneath the photograph was,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain Thurston K. Hollister, awarded the Distinguished Service Cross\\r\\nfor Gallantry in France.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The story below mentioned the fact that the\\r\\nman who had been given this recognition had disappeared and could not\\r\\nbe found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blood sang. She had known from that first day he was of good\\r\\nblood, but she had not been sure that his record was worthy of him. He\\r\\nhad not only fought in France; he had covered himself with glory. It\\r\\nwas almost too good to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was on the porch to meet her father before he had swung down from\\r\\nthe saddle. He told her details of the affair at Elk Creek as far as he\\r\\nhad heard them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty had cut the Hollister story out of the paper. She handed it to\\r\\nher father, all but the picture folded under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is this, Daddy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed glanced at it and answered promptly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like that young fellow\\r\\nJones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTriumphantly she nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s who it is. Read what it says about\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cattleman read. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHmp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grunted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I called him a slacker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter now what you called him, Dad. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m awf\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly glad he\\r\\nwasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stunt that--breakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up a German machine-gun nest and\\r\\nsittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tight for two days under fire till the boys reached him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clint\\r\\nsmiled sardonically, the memory of the tongue-lashing he had given this\\r\\nman still vividly with him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon I can be more kinds of a durn\\r\\nfool in an hour than \\xe2\\x80\\x99most anybody you know, Bess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so glad he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making good with Justin. I just knew he was a\\r\\nsplendid fellow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so dawg-goned hot-headed. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 give myself time to cool\\r\\noff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grumbled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe told Justin about it. The doctors gave him a lot of morphine or\\r\\nsomething when he was wounded and he got in the habit of using it to\\r\\nrelieve the pain. Before he knew it he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d learn a lick or two of sense, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me \\xe2\\x80\\x99most fifty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touched the stuff since he went up to the dam. Justin says\\r\\nit must have been horrible for him. Some nights he kept walking till\\r\\nmorning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat else was it I called him besides a slacker--after I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d beat him up\\r\\ntill he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 him a sick man at that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty laughed at the way each of them, absorbed in a personal point of\\r\\nview, was carrying on a one-sided conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you going up to Elk Creek to-day, Dad? If you are, I wish you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nlet me go along.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was thinkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about it. Like to go, would you? All right. We might\\r\\ndrive and take Ruthie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be fine. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty flew into the house to get ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nA HOT TRAIL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSheriff Daniels rode across the hogback above Elk Creek to a small\\r\\nranch recently taken up by a homesteader, much to the annoyance of Jake\\r\\nProwers. He found the man in a shed that served temporarily as a barn.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a cow was proudly licking a very wobbly calf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Lo, Sheriff. How\\xe2\\x80\\x99re things comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with you? Fine an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dandy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo complaint, Howard. Had an increase in yore herd, looks like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYessir, though it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look much thataway \\xe2\\x80\\x99bout three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock this\\r\\nmo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning a.m.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome near losing her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBet I did. Both of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em. But you never can tell, as the old sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is.\\r\\nI stayed with it, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come across the hogback to have a chin with Black. Know whether he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhome?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the officer asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. He passed down the road whilst I was up with old\\r\\nbossie here right early.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheriff complimented his humor by repeating it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock\\r\\nthis mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning a.m.?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYessir. I figured he must be going somewheres to be settin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 off at\\r\\nthat time o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlone, was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, no, I reckon there was some one with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels threw a leg across a feed-rack, drew out a knife from his\\r\\npocket, and began to sharpen it on the leather of his boot. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDark as\\r\\nall git out, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? How\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you know it was Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe homesteader grinned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery daisy in the dell knows his story too\\r\\ndarned well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he parodied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSingin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sweet Marie,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep. Say, what kind of a mash would you feed her? She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right feverish\\r\\nyet, I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wonder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheriff gave advice out of his experience before he came back ten\\r\\nminutes later to a subject that interested him more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon was out rounding-up cattle yesterday, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he? Seems some one\\r\\ntold me so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLikely enough. He was away from the shack all day. Wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t home by\\r\\ndark. I seen a light up there somewheres about nine-thirty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer rode up to the cabin Black was using. The door was\\r\\nhospitably unlatched, but nobody was at home. Daniels walked in and\\r\\nlooked around. It was both dirty and untidy, but it told no tales of\\r\\nwhat its occupant had been doing in the past twenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels remounted, skirted the edge of the Government reserve, and\\r\\ndescended a draw which led into a small gorge almost concealed by a\\r\\ngrove of young quaking asps. This received its name from box elders\\r\\ngrowing up the sides. If Black and his friends had rounded up a bunch\\r\\nof cattle during the day, and wanted to keep them unobserved until they\\r\\ncould be stampeded into Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on, there was no handier spot to\\r\\nhold them than in this little gulch. The sheriff had ridden these hills\\r\\ntoo many years as a cattleman not to know the country like a familiar\\r\\nbook. In his youth, while riding as a puncher for Prowers, he and a\\r\\ncompanion had been caught in a blizzard and reached Box Elder Ca\\xc3\\xb1on in\\r\\ntime to save themselves by building a fire. Since then he had been here\\r\\nmany times.\\r\\n\\r\\nA one-room log cabin clung to the slope at the edge of the quaking\\r\\nasps. It had been built by a hermit prospector thirty years before,\\r\\nand had many times in the intervening years been the refuge of belated\\r\\npunchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer walked in through the sagging door. On the floor was a roll\\r\\nof soiled blankets. Greasy dishes and remnants of food were on the\\r\\nhome-made table. Three persons had eaten here as late as this morning.\\r\\nHe could tell that by the live coals among the charred ends of wood\\r\\nin the fireplace. Also, the lard left in the frying-pan had not yet\\r\\nhardened.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels made deductions. Of the three, one had spent the night here to\\r\\nkeep an eye on the cattle, assuming that his guess about the herd was\\r\\na correct one. The other two had ridden up to Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabin and slept\\r\\nthere, returning in the early morning for the drive to Elk Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the cabin the sheriff walked down into the bottom of the gulch.\\r\\nThere was plenty of evidence to show that a large number of cattle had\\r\\nbeen here very recently. He followed the trail they made out of the\\r\\nca\\xc3\\xb1on to the mesa and saw that it headed toward Elk Creek. He could not\\r\\nbe quite sure, but he believed that three horsemen rode after them. The\\r\\ncharacter of the ground made certainty impossible. The tracks were all\\r\\nfaint and blurred. Daniels followed them for two or three miles to the\\r\\nrim of the draw down which the frightened herd had been stampeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheriff rode across the hills to the Circle J P ranch. He found\\r\\nJake Prowers and Don Black greasing a wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack looked up as the officer came around the corner of the house\\r\\nand thrust his hand beneath the belt of his trousers. Prowers said\\r\\nsomething to him in a low voice and the hand came out empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels rode up and looked down at them. He gave a little nod of\\r\\ngreeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do, Jake--Don? I dropped over to talk with you about that business\\r\\nin Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Black suspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to hear all you know about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers answered promptly and smoothly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know a thing about it,\\r\\nif you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re meanin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me, except what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard over the \\xe2\\x80\\x99phone. The story\\r\\nis, some cattle stampeded an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a fellow got in their way--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know the story, Jake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sheriff interrupted quietly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\naskin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you what you can tell me about that stampede.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe! Why pick on me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the wrinkled little man piped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I tell you\\r\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know a thing about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow about you, Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Daniels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon don\\xe2\\x80\\x99 know a thing--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalk for himself, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he, Jake?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sheriff wanted to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get on the prod, Frank,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d advised the owner of the Circle J P.\\r\\nVoice and manner were still mild and harmless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed Daniels, smiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow about it, Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack met his steady gaze sulkily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know there was a stampede\\r\\ntill Jake told me so after he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been at the \\xe2\\x80\\x99phone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expect you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a chance to prove that, Don. I got to arrest you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded the dark man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor causing the death of that fellow in the ca\\xc3\\xb1on this mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning by\\r\\nstampeding cattle down the draw.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny evidence, Frank?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This from Prowers, on whose face a thin lip\\r\\nsmile rested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome. Don made threats yesterday. He spent the day rounding-up cattle\\r\\nand drove \\xe2\\x80\\x99em into Box Elder Ca\\xc3\\xb1on for the night. About nine in the\\r\\nevening he reached home an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ate supper there, him and another fellow.\\r\\nThey took the road back to the ca\\xc3\\xb1on before daybreak this mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning--not\\r\\nlater than three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock. A friend of theirs stayed in the old\\r\\nThorwaldson cabin to watch the stock. They ate breakfast with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA flicker of fire burned in the skim-milk eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy, Frank, you know a\\r\\nlot. Anything more?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome things I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, I only guess, Jake. I know Don an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 his\\r\\nfriends had ham and cornbread and coffee for breakfast, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow yet who his two friends are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly guess that, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, Jake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll know that soon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jeered Prowers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny one with an imagination\\r\\nactive as yore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thing like facts stand in his way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to take Don down to Wild Horse with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Daniels replied\\r\\nimpassively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yore business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the old cattleman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a\\r\\nmistake. Don spent the night with me, if you want to know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend it with him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou arrestin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me, too, Frank?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly guessin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 at me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing my guessin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out loud--not all of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsplenetic laugh cackled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ought to get one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 these brass\\r\\nstars from a detective agency, by jiminy by jinks. A fellow that can\\r\\nmind-read Don here an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tell what he had for breakfast is a sure-enough\\r\\nsleuth and no ornery sheriff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old cattleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irony did not disturb Daniels. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know what he had\\r\\nfor breakfast because I saw the fry-pan an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the dishes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter go slap a saddle on yore horse, Don,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jeered Prowers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narrestin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you because you had ham an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cornbread an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 coffee for\\r\\nbreakfast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m arrestin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have plenty of chances to show\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not guilty if he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the sheriff answered, not unamiably.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe owner of the Circle J P spoke to Black. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaddle old Baldy for\\r\\nme. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ride down to Wild Horse with you. Reckon I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to go on\\r\\nyore bond. No use us gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 annoyed. Election ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so fur away now.\\r\\nFrank has got to make a showing. We hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ought to grudge him some\\r\\ngrandstandin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels smiled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way to look at it, Jake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPTAIN THURSTON K. HOLLISTER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth squealed with delight and clapped her hands when Betty told her of\\r\\nthe approaching drive to Elk Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, goody, goody! An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take Prince \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Baby Fifi \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rover.\\r\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll enjoy the ride too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a smile that took the sting out of her refusal, Betty vetoed this\\r\\nwholesale transportation of puppies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t room, dear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face registered disappointment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could take \\xe2\\x80\\x99em on my\\r\\nlap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she proposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty reflected a moment, then decided briskly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take one to-day,\\r\\nand the others next time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUmpha!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ruth nodded approbation vigorously, all animation again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99splain it to \\xe2\\x80\\x99em so\\xe2\\x80\\x99s they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have their feelin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hurted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blue eyes of the little girl inspected judicially the small\\r\\ncreatures whose tilted heads and wagging tails appealed to her. To\\r\\ndecide which one to take was a matter of grave consideration. Their\\r\\nmistress wanted to do exact justice. She changed her mind several\\r\\ntimes, but voted at last for Baby Fifi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the teentiest, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course the baby must go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told the\\r\\nother two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey accepted without protest the verdict of the super-goddess who\\r\\nwas mistress of their destinies. Apparently they took the occasion as\\r\\nseriously as she did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99N\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the delicatest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bee-have,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 everyfing, Mamma\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring you somefing awful nice. So you be the\\r\\ngoodest children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it chanced that Baby Fifi, a clean blue ribbon tied round her neck\\r\\nin honor of the event, looked out from the tonneau of the car upon a\\r\\npanorama of blue sky and bluer mountain and sunbathed foothill moving\\r\\npast in a glory of splendor satisfying to both eye and soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove to the lower mouth of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. A man with pick and shovel\\r\\nwas clearing rocks and d\\xc3\\xa9bris away from what was evidently to be the\\r\\nline of the ditch. Reed guessed that he was really posted at this point\\r\\nas a sentinel to guard against another possible attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boss of the gang, the man said, was doing some surveying from the\\r\\ntop of the wall above the rim of the gorge. A steep and rough road led\\r\\nto the upper mesa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know as you can make it with your car,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the man with the pick\\r\\nadded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mighty stiff grade when you get past the dugway, \\xe2\\x80\\x99most\\r\\nall a team can do to get up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go far as we can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reed answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to go into low long before they reached the dugway. Just beyond\\r\\nit was a stretch of road so precipitous that the car balked. The cowman\\r\\nbecame convinced that the machine could go no farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave to walk the rest of the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty looked at her little sister dubiously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a hard climb for\\r\\nthose little legs, and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too heavy to carry far. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better leave\\r\\nher in the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe we had,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assented her father, and added, in a low voice: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Ruthie doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind that. Do you, dearest, a big girl like you?\\r\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have Baby Fifi, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not be gone half an hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth accepted her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment without demur. She would rather\\r\\nplay with Baby Fifi than tire herself climbing the long hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStay right in the car, dear. Daddy and Betty won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be long,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the young\\r\\nwoman said, waving a hand as she started.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty breasted the slope with the light, free step of a mountaineer.\\r\\nThough slender, she was far from frail. Tested muscles moved with\\r\\nperfect co\\xc3\\xb6rdination beneath the smooth satiny skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt sight of her an eye leveled behind a surveyor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transit became\\r\\ninstantly alive. The man caught his breath and watched eagerly. In\\r\\nher grace was something fawnlike, a suggestion of sylvan innocence\\r\\nand na\\xc3\\xafvet\\xc3\\xa9. Was it the quality of which this was an expression that\\r\\ndistinguished her from a score of other nice girls he knew? Did she\\r\\nstill retain from the childhood of the race a primal simplicity the\\r\\nothers had lost by reason of their environment? What was it Wordsworth\\r\\nhad written?--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c... trailing clouds of glory do we come\\r\\n        From God, who is our home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glory still haloed her dusky head. It glowed in her warm eyes and\\r\\nsparkled in her smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe strode through the kinnikinnick to meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they approached, Betty was conscious of a sharp stab of joy. This\\r\\nclean-cut, light-footed man was not the shuffling, slouchy tramp she\\r\\nhad first met two months earlier. The skin had taken on the bronzed hue\\r\\nof health. The eyes were no longer dull and heavy, but quick with life.\\r\\nThe unpleasant, bitter expression had gone from the good-looking face.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty knew what had transformed him. He had found again the\\r\\nself-reliance of which he had been robbed. There burned in him once\\r\\nmore a bright light of manhood strong and unwavering.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook hands with Clint Reed so frankly that she knew he cherished no\\r\\ngrudge. There flashed into her mind the hesitant prophecy she had once\\r\\nmade, that he might look back on that first day on the Diamond Bar K\\r\\nas a red-letter one. It had come true. Then he had reached the turning\\r\\nof the ways and had been led into the long hard uphill climb toward\\r\\nself-respect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlad to see you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said as his fingers met firmly those of the girl.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to see how Mr. Merrick is getting along with the project,\\r\\nI suppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe heard about the trouble here and came to find out the facts\\r\\nfirst-hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reed answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer told what he knew. One of his assistants standing near was\\r\\ndrawn into the conversation. The cattleman asked him questions. Betty\\r\\nand the man who called himself Tug Jones found themselves momentarily\\r\\nalone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFortunate I was here when you came,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the young man said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother man\\r\\nis taking charge. Mr. Merrick is putting me somewhere else. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow where, but I report for duty at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty took from her handbag a clipping from a newspaper. She had\\r\\nwritten the date of publication on the headlines. It was about nine\\r\\nmonths before that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe handed the slip of paper to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you ever hear of Captain Thurston K. Hollister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl asked,\\r\\non a note of tremulousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked during what seemed a long silence at the picture of the\\r\\nofficer in uniform and the caption beneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere did you get this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found it covering our pantry shelf, where it had been ever since\\r\\nspring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve brought it to me because you think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Hollister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know quite what you mean. Why are you glad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom that first day I knew you were--somebody. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I be glad to\\r\\nlearn I was right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe read the clipping, and as his eyes moved down the column there came\\r\\nover his face a touch of the sardonic bitterness she knew of old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI deserve a cross, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo of them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried impetuously.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked into her ardent, generous eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, half a dozen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he mocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she noticed the mordant flash was gone. What she did not know was\\r\\nthat her faith had exorcised it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl insisted, an underlying flush of color in the dark\\r\\ncheeks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne for this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She touched the paper he was holding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the other?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, not yet caught up with her leaping thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nA qualm of fear shook her courage. Ought she to speak of it? Was she\\r\\none of those who \\xe2\\x80\\x9crush in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d? It was his personal business, and he had a\\r\\nright to resent any mention of it by her. But the desire was strong in\\r\\nher to say just a word and then close the subject for always.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor that braver thing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing every day since I saw you\\r\\nlast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, too, flushed beneath the tan of the cheeks. Their eyes held fast an\\r\\ninstant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he spoke, it was to say with studied lightness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou and your\\r\\nfather didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t walk up, did you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty was relieved. It is an embarrassing thing to talk with a man\\r\\nabout those hidden things of his life that are important to him. She\\r\\nfelt almost as though she had escaped from some peril.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, the car\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the road halfway up the hill. We couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it.\\r\\nRuth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waiting for us there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered, hurrying to follow the lead\\r\\nhe had given. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has her favorite little puppy in the car with her.\\r\\nWe thought the climb up might be a little too much for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister walked back with them to the car. He talked with her father\\r\\nabout the outrage that had resulted in the death of poor Coyle. Betty\\r\\nwalked beside the men, saying nothing. She was acutely conscious of the\\r\\npresence of the sunburnt young fellow beside her. His rags had given\\r\\nplace to a serviceable khaki that modeled itself to the clean lines\\r\\nof his figure. He walked firmly and lightly, with character. It was\\r\\nobservable that he had shaved not many hours since. There was a faint\\r\\nline of golden hair along the cheekbone at the place where the stroke\\r\\nof the razor had terminated. He was not wearing a hat. The girl liked\\r\\nthe way his copper-red hair crisped in short curls over his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJake Prowers, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s who,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father was saying. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll maybe hide\\r\\nbehind Black. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way the old wolf does business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like a wolf.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This from Hollister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. More like a sheep. But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let that fool you. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most\\r\\ndangerous man in this county. Jake pulled this off to serve notice that\\r\\nit wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t safe to work here in the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. Might have been a dozen men\\r\\nkilled. A lot he cares for that. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find his tracks are covered,\\r\\ntoo. He won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show at all, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 there won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be evidence enough to\\r\\nconvict Black or anybody else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty heard with her surface mind what they were saying, but the\\r\\nundercurrent of it was considering something else. Was Hollister\\r\\noffended at her? Had he meant to rebuff her for presumption? There had\\r\\nbeen a certain rigor in his inscrutable face when he had turned the\\r\\nconversation. Already she was castigating herself for officiousness.\\r\\nDid he think her bold, unmaidenly? Well, he had a right to think it.\\r\\nWhatever had possessed her to say what she had? She had meant well, of\\r\\ncourse, but that can be said of half the fools of the world in their\\r\\nfolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby Fifi came prancing up the road to meet them with ineffective puppy\\r\\nbarks of welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty picked up the small dog and questioned it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid Ruth send you to\\r\\nmeet us? And did you both have a good time while we were away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child was not in the car. Betty smiled at her father. Both of them\\r\\nknew the ways of Mistress Ruth. Presently she would pounce on them from\\r\\nbehind that rock just above the road with piping shrieks of glee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere can she be, Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty asked, in a voice intended to carry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nClint did not finish his sentence. His gaze had fastened on a cigarette\\r\\nstub lying on the running-board of the car. It had not been there when\\r\\nthey left. He was sure of that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty caught the note of tenseness in his voice. Her eyes followed his\\r\\nto the bit of cigarette. She was not frightened. There was nothing to\\r\\nbe afraid of. Nobody in these hills would hurt Ruth. None the less,\\r\\nher heart action quickened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRuth!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she called.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nClint called, sharply, imperatively. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome out, Ruth! No nonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child did not appear. Hollister clambered up and looked back of the\\r\\nbig rock. She was not there. They searched the hillside, shouting as\\r\\nthey did so.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth was not to be found. The echo of their alarmed voices was the only\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nA CLASH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom behind the cover of a huge boulder on the steep hillside a man\\r\\nwatched a car labor up the grade and give up. He trained field-glasses\\r\\non the occupants. From his throat there came a sound like the snarl of\\r\\na wild animal. He had recognized the driver and the girl in the tonneau.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of a hip pocket he drew an automatic revolver. His teeth bared like\\r\\nthe fangs of a wolf. Not once did his eyes lift from the driver and the\\r\\nyoung woman with him until they disappeared round a bend in the road\\r\\nabove.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose and stretched his cramped limbs, then moved cautiously down\\r\\nthe hill slope to the car. A child was in the back seat playing with a\\r\\npuppy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMamma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gotta go to town an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 buy Baby Fifi some shoes wif silver\\r\\nbuckles \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a new blue dress \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 free pair of stockings. \\xe2\\x80\\x99N\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while\\r\\nshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone, you better bee-have or Mamma\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to spank you good when\\r\\nshe gets back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the little girl advised.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sound of footsteps she looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gay make-believe fled her face. Surrounded by love though she had\\r\\nalways been, some instinct told her that this man represented for her\\r\\nthe opposite of it. She felt a sudden imperative desire to call to her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yer name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the man asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRuth Reed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat Clint Reed yer dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told him he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teeth showed like fangs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWot luck! We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pals, him an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take yer along with old Cig.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wantta go. I want my daddy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ruth announced promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis grin widened. It was an evil thing to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want you, too, a while before he gets yer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he jeered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened the door of the tonneau and stood on the running-board. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome\\r\\nhere, kid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth shrank back to the farther side of the car. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou go \\xe2\\x80\\x99way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ncall my daddy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe caught her by the frock and dragged her forward. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCut out that\\r\\nstuff, missie. When Cig says to step lively, why, you get a hop on yer.\\r\\nSee?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to scream. He clapped a dirty hand over the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth and\\r\\nturned to climb the mountainside with her in his arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth kicked fiercely, impelled by terror. His right arm tightened on\\r\\nthe struggling legs. The tramp climbed fast. He had to get over the\\r\\nsummit before Reed came back or he would be in trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt an altitude of a mile and a half the breath comes short when a\\r\\nstrain is put on the lungs and heart. Cig panted as he struggled up the\\r\\nrock-strewn slope. The weight in his arms dragged him down. More than\\r\\nonce he slipped on the dry grass and just recovered himself without\\r\\nstumbling. Before he reached the divide, he was hot and exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he dared not stop to rest. Once, near the crest, he turned for an\\r\\ninstant to make sure he had not been seen. His eyes swept the road\\r\\nanxiously. Nobody was in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth twisted her mouth free and began to shriek. He clamped his hand\\r\\nover her lips again with an oath. It was all he could do to stagger\\r\\nwith her over the rocky brow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, for the moment, he was safe. With the sleeve of his coat he wiped\\r\\nthe perspiration out of his eyes and from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nA saddled horse was tied to a stunted pine not far away. He dragged the\\r\\nchild to it, mounted, and hauled her up in front of him. A moment, and\\r\\nthe hoofs of the cowpony rang out as they struck the stony rubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig had never been on a horse till recently. It could not be claimed\\r\\nthat he really knew how to ride now. But he could stick on if the\\r\\nanimal was gentle. The ways of the West were not his ways. He could not\\r\\nwalk out a mile from the cabin where he was staying and not get lost,\\r\\nunless he followed familiar trails. For he was up in the high lands of\\r\\nthe Rockies, in a district broken with ravines of twisted pines and\\r\\njutting rock outcroppings. Each hill and draw and gorge looked to him\\r\\njust like its neighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig rode into a small ca\\xc3\\xb1on the entrance of which was well concealed by\\r\\na growth of young quaking asps. Through these he pushed to a cabin on\\r\\nthe edge of the grove.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped the child to the ground and swung down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou take me back to my daddy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNix on that stuff. Old Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna keep yer right here with him. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nlearn Clint Reed how safe it is to beat me up like his men done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wantta go to my daddy. You take me to my daddy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the child wailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hobo picked up a switch lying on the ground. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYouse stop whinin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\r\\nHear me? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not have it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snarled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner was so threatening that the sobs stuck in her throat. She\\r\\nshivered with dread, while she tried to fight back the expression of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI--I want my sister Betty an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 my daddy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whimpered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCut it out!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered from a corner of his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth flung herself to the ground and gave way to a passionate outbreak\\r\\nof grief and terror. The violence of her emotion shook the small body\\r\\nof the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig took a step toward her, switch in hand. He stopped. A sound had\\r\\nreached him. Something was moving in the quaking asps.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men emerged along the winding trail. They were on horseback. The\\r\\none riding in front was Jake Prowers, the other Don Black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp waved a hand at them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWoilcome to our city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called,\\r\\ngrinning toward them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 look who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers pulled up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the jumpin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Jehosaphat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got lonesome, so I brought back comp\\xe2\\x80\\x99ny for myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained Cig.\\r\\nIt was plain that he was proud of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you get her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown above Elk Creek?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas she lost?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLost!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The tramp snickered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so you could notice it none. She was\\r\\nsittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in a car waitin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for Clint Reed an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that high-heeled goil of\\r\\nhis to come back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut--what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s she doing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inquired Black, still in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, I brought her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig sneered contempt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you got any brains under that big lid you\\r\\nwear? I brought her because she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Clint Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kid, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t squared\\r\\nmy account with him. See?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAny one watching closely would have seen a change in Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\nSomething hard and steely passed into them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to do with\\r\\nher?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t made up my mind. Mebbe I never will give her back. Mebbe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nstick that bird Reed for a ransom. No can tell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black swung from the saddle and lounged forward in the\\r\\nbandy-legged, high-heeled fashion of the range rider. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\r\\nguessin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 my own self. Mebbe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take her right back to Clint p.d.q.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes of the crook narrowed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, where d\\xe2\\x80\\x99youse get that stuff,\\r\\nfellow? When was youse elected king o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Prooshia?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of an outfit do you figure this is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the range rider asked.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 war on kids, do you? Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho asked youse to butt in on my business?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig crouched, snarling, a\\r\\nmenace and a threat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supposed to be safe for black-headed\\r\\nguys, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot yore business any more\\xe2\\x80\\x99n mine. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in this together. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell\\r\\nyou right now you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pull a play like that an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 get away with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The New Yorker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lip curled in a sneer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSays _you_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSays _I_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steady gaze did not waver a thousandth part of an\\r\\ninch.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig spoke to Prowers, jerking the thumb of his left hand toward the\\r\\ncowpuncher. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eatin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 this black bird? He claims to be sore at\\r\\nthis Reed guy, same as we are. He ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t above stampedin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cattle onto\\r\\nsleepin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 men and croakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x99em. Mebbe he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yellow an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ready to\\r\\nrap to the bulls. Mebbe--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quid of tobacco stood out in Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheek like a marble. His jaws\\r\\nhad stopped moving. He, too, addressed the old cattleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCall off this wolf of yore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Jake, onless you want him sent to\\r\\nKingdom Come. Nobody can tell me I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m yellow without a come-back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid in a low, even voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers had been watching them both, curious, vigilant, small intent\\r\\neyes sweeping from one to the other as the quarrel progressed. Now he\\r\\nspoke, curtly, first to the homesteader, then to the crook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pull yore picket pin, Don. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be enough, Cig. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need\\r\\nany demonstration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack did not for an instant relax his rigid wariness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nwaitin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to find out, Jake. He said I was yellow an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ready to\\r\\nsqueal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBack water, you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ranchman ordered Cig.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig hesitated, still defiant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for no trouble--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, of course, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell Don there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to what you said, that\\r\\nyou was a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 het up under the collar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c--but I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t duckin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it either. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m willing to eat what I said, but\\r\\nhe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dictate about the kid. See?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cattleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light eyes stabbed bleakly at the man. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nplayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a lone hand, Cig. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right about it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all in this. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nanother thing. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you forget for a minute that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do as I say,\\r\\nyou an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Don both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack looked at his employer with a kind of fierce resentment. He had\\r\\nfollowed this man a good many years, not to his own good. There had\\r\\nbeen times when he had been close to a break with him, but Prowers\\r\\nheld for him a sinister attraction. He never had liked him, yet could\\r\\nnot escape his influence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about the kid? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m standin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pat on that, Jake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old cattleman reflected. By nature he had in him a vein secretive\\r\\nand malignant. The thought of striking at Clint Reed through his little\\r\\ngirl was not repellent to him. But he had lived fifty years in the\\r\\nWest and knew its standards. The thing that Cig had done, unless it\\r\\nwere promptly repudiated by him, would make Paradise Valley and the\\r\\nadjoining mountains buzz like a hornets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nest. His allies would fall\\r\\naway from him instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take the kid back home to Clint, Don,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntell him we sent her back soon as we found she had been taken. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell him. No mention of Cig here. Understand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jaws began to move again regularly and evenly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuits me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nagreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen do I go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, the sooner the quicker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instinct of a child as to grown-ups is not always sound, but Ruth\\r\\nknew which of these three was her friend. She had run to Black and\\r\\ncaught him by the coat, screening herself behind him. His hand rested\\r\\non the soft flaxen hair gently. Don was a bad _hombre_, a hard, tough\\r\\ncitizen. But something tugged at his heart now. He knew that if it had\\r\\nbeen necessary bullets would have stabbed the air to save the little\\r\\ngirl who had put herself under his protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, Don. Turn her over to Clint with my compliments. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you\\r\\nbrought her home soon as we found her. No explanations. Let him take it\\r\\nor leave it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI getcha. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be thataway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had swung to the saddle he lifted the child to the back of the\\r\\nhorse. She was still sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99cha, honey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he soothed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you right home to yore paw.\\r\\nThat bad man ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gonna hurt you none.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode out of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on and across the hills. Nobody knew this country\\r\\nbetter than Black. All his life he had ridden it. Following the path of\\r\\nleast resistance, he deflected many times from the airline that led to\\r\\nthe Diamond Bar K; but none could have traveled a shorter distance to\\r\\nreach it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the hour he was jogging down into Paradise Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cloud of dust in the distance caught his eye. It was moving swiftly\\r\\nalong a road toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome folks in a powerful hurry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he murmured aloud, and guessed at\\r\\nonce the reason for their haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis fingers closed for an instant on the butt of a revolver to make\\r\\nsure there would be no hitch in the draw in case of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the riders drew near, he held up the palm of his hand to stop them.\\r\\nHe counted eight. Clint Reed and Lon Forbes were in the lead. Betty was\\r\\namong the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon I got here what you want, Clint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black said evenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lowered Ruth from the saddle and she ran to her father. Clint swung\\r\\ndown and caught her into his arms with a sound in his throat that was\\r\\nlike a dry sob. He murmured broken endearments while he fondled her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, daddy, my daddy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ruth wailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty swung from the saddle and ran to them. Clint passed the child\\r\\nto her. They clung together, Betty crooning little love words of\\r\\nhappiness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRuthie--Ruthie--darling--precious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween hugs and kisses Ruth explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bad man tooked me \\xe2\\x80\\x99way \\xe2\\x80\\x99way\\r\\noff on a horse \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we rode \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we rode. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Nen anuvver man comed \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d bring me home, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he did bring me, the nice man did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed strode across the road to the man who had brought back his child.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear your story, Black,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said sternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reckon I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got any story to tell, Clint--none in particular.\\r\\nShe was lost. I found her an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 brought her back. Ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that enough?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. Where did you find her? Who took her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 doing on that witness-stand stuff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the other answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJake\\r\\nProwers an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me was lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for strays up on Elk Creek when we found\\r\\nher. Jake told me to tell you here she was with his compliments. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall I know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou and Jake found her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYessir. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I tell you that twict?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas she alone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a guy with her, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know him. He lit out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fellow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see him right close.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The quid of tobacco stuck out in\\r\\nthe homesteader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheek. He watched Reed closely, jaws motionless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not a good liar, Black. You know a lot more than you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\r\\ntelling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the owner of the Diamond Bar K accused. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna have it\\r\\nout of you, man, if I have to tear it from your throat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s figure stiffened. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry any funny business with me, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nshow you where to head in at, Clint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you ask the kid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Forbes said in an aside to his employer.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlack didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t steal her. A blind man could see that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe knows who did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hell-bent not to tell. You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it outa him. I\\r\\nknow Don.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some of Jake Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it, Clint.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The foreman turned to Ruth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho was it took\\r\\nyou outa the automobile, honey?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man. He was gonna whip me wiv a great big stick, like he said Daddy\\r\\ndid him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat? Whip you, like--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lon stopped to wrestle with and overthrow\\r\\na thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, dog-gone my hide, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that tramp Daniels has been\\r\\nlookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nClint fired questions at Black like shots out of a machine gun. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas he\\r\\na small man? Lean? Town clothes? Talk outa the corner of his mouth? A\\r\\nrat-faced fellow? Fingers cigarette-stained?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sure enough got me there, Clint. I only\\r\\nseen him at a distance, but seemed like he was a big husky guy. Yes,\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m \\xe2\\x80\\x99most sure he was. Big as the side of a barn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid he seem big to you, Ruthie?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lon asked gently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUmpha!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She nodded her head vigorously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was a nawful man, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he\\r\\nsaid he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d whip me like Daddy did him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalk like this, honey?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lon drew down a corner of his mouth and spoke\\r\\nout of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98De king o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Prooshia on de job.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer curls danced violently up and down with acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman turned to Reed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sure enough the same bird. Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhe been keepin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 himself at, you reckon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJake Prowers could tell us that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his employer replied grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis suggested another question to Forbes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen, honey Ruth. This\\r\\nhere bad man--did him an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Black here act kinda like they was friends?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey had a fuss,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Bout me. The bad man said I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 home to Daddy, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said\\r\\nI was too. They had a nawful fuss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bad man an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Black here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99N\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he tooked me on his horse \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 broughted me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes drew aside his friend and spoke low. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got it\\r\\non you, Clint. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about the size of it, the way I figure it. This\\r\\nscalawag Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hidin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out in the hills. Jake Prowers is likely lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nafter him. Well, he steals Ruth, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Don here bumps into him whilst\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 his getaway. They have a rumpus, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Don brings her home.\\r\\nHe acted pretty near like a white man, seems to me. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Course, he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ngonna give away this tramp if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s push. That wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbe hardly reasonable to expect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I reckon not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d admitted Reed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou got no kick at Black. Hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been for him I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bet Ruth wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 been here a-tall. Point is, that with him there Jake and this Cig\\r\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put over any shenanigan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe owner of the Diamond Bar K stepped across to the homesteader. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake\\r\\nit all back, Don. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mightily obliged to you for bringing my li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\ngirl home. If I ever get a chance--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right. What do you take me for,\\r\\nanyhow? I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any Apache. Why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I bring a kid home when I find\\r\\nher lost? You birds make me tired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded brusquely, wheeled his horse, and rode away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\nIRREFUTABLE LOGIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick sat at a table in the log cabin that served him as field\\r\\nheadquarters. A cheap lamp pinned down one corner of the map in front\\r\\nof him, a jar of tobacco the opposite one. Tug Hollister looked over\\r\\nhis shoulder. He was here to get instructions for his new assignment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPi\\xc3\\xb1on knots crackled cheerfully in the fireplace, emphasizing the\\r\\ncomfort within the cabin as compared with the weather outside. It was\\r\\nraining heavily and had been for forty-eight hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where the engineers of the Reclamation Service ran their\\r\\nlines,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Merrick said, following with the point of a pencil a crooked\\r\\ncourse from Sweetwater Dam to the upper mouth of Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\r\\nmade a mistake, probably because they were short of time. It was clear\\r\\nthat the water from the dam had to get down to the Flat Tops by way of\\r\\nElk Creek if at all. As soon as they learned that the upper entrance\\r\\nto the ca\\xc3\\xb1on is higher than the site of the dam by eighty feet they\\r\\nadmitted the project would not do. All the reports are based on that.\\r\\nWater won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t flow uphill. Therefore no feasible connecting canal could\\r\\nbe built.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister walked round and took the chair at the other side of the\\r\\ntable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIrrefutable logic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely. But I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure of the facts upon which it was based.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean you weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure the canal had to run to the upper mouth of\\r\\nthe ca\\xc3\\xb1on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief of construction looked at his assistant quickly. This young\\r\\nfellow had more than once surprised Merrick by the clearness of his\\r\\ndeductions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExactly that. So I proceeded to find out for myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you learned that you could carry it over the hills and down the\\r\\ndraw where Prowers stampeded the cattle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you know that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded Merrick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMore irrefutable logic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister tilted back his chair and smiled.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only one break in the walls of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on in the whole five\\r\\nmiles. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at the draw near the lower mouth. Since the ditch must\\r\\nget into the foothills from the gorge and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reach them any other\\r\\nway, and since it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enter the ca\\xc3\\xb1on at the upper end on account of\\r\\nthe law of gravity, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m driven to the alternative--and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the draw.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou use your brains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d admitted the older man dryly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nright. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going down the draw.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen the survey you had me make of the upper part of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on was\\r\\ncamouflage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A smile of grim amusement broke the lines of his firm mouth.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homestead claim doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reach as far down as the draw. Prowers\\r\\nthought it would be enough to close the upper mouth of the gorge to\\r\\nus. So we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch his land at all--don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come within miles of it\\r\\nin point of fact. To make sure Prowers won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t jump in later, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a\\r\\ndummy file on the draw.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister looked at his chief with admiration. The man had all the\\r\\nqualities that make for success--technical skill, audacity, confidence\\r\\nin himself, steadiness, force, restrained imagination, and a certain\\r\\ncapacity for indomitable perseverance. He would go a long way, in spite\\r\\nof the fact that he was not quite the ideal leader, or perhaps because\\r\\nof the lack of the fire that inspires subordinates. For he was not\\r\\none to let a generous enthusiasm sweep him from the moorings of common\\r\\nsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made the canal survey to the draw?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the younger man asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. A hogback below Jake\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fork bars the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going round it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Through it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re to begin running the tunnel to-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey discussed plans, details, equipment necessary to attack the\\r\\nhogback.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister moved camp next day in a pelting rain and set up his tents\\r\\non the soggy hillside close to the ridge. For a week the rain kept up\\r\\nalmost steadily. The whole country was sloshing with moisture. During\\r\\na visit to the main camp for a consultation with Merrick, he went down\\r\\nto the dam and observed that a heavy flow of water was pouring into\\r\\nthe reservoir. With an ordinary winter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s snowfall in the mountains,\\r\\nSweetwater would be full to the brim long before the spring freshets\\r\\nhad ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay by day the drills bored deeper into the hogback and the tunnel grew\\r\\nlonger. By means of a chance rider of the hills, word reached Prowers\\r\\nof it. He and Don Black, who was out on bond signed by Jake, rode over\\r\\nto see what this new development meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you fellows think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the cattleman in his\\r\\nhigh, crackling voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMining,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Hollister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the idea?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re driving a tunnel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got eyes, young fellow. What for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Merrick didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell me what he wanted it for. He told me to get\\r\\nbusy. Mine not to reason why, Mr. Prowers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmart, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, by jiminy by jinks?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA foreman came up and propounded a difficulty to Hollister. That young\\r\\nman walked briskly away to look the matter over and did not return. The\\r\\ntwo riders hung around for a time, then disappeared over the brow of a\\r\\nhill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe old man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got something to think about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman said to\\r\\nHollister, chuckling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and his thinking will bring him straight to one conclusion; that\\r\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to run through Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homestead claim. When he figures\\r\\nout where we _are_ going, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite see what he can do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNor I, but we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t foresee what he would do last time. He killed\\r\\npoor Coyle, and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave enough evidence to prove in a law court\\r\\nthat he did it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ought to be behind the bars right now--him an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that Black too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthe foreman said bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not--and they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his reputation, to do all\\r\\nsorts of deviltry and get away with it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why men won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cross him,\\r\\nwhy they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so afraid of him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no scruples and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as cunning\\r\\nas the devil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tough nut, too. He don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look it, with them\\r\\nskim-milk eyes of his and that little squeaky voice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. Size him up beside Merrick, say, and he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look effective,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nadmitted Hollister. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of these quiet sure killers,\\r\\naccording to the stories they tell. Not a fighting man, unless he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got\\r\\nhis back to the wall. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard of dry-gulching. It means shooting\\r\\nan enemy from ambush when he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re within fifty miles.\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style. He gives me a creepy feeling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere, too. You know that fool cackling laugh of his. Well, the other\\r\\nday when he was pulling off the ha-ha I got a look from him that jolted\\r\\nme. Lord, it dried my blood up. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hate to meet him in one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 them dry\\r\\ngulches if he had any reason for wantin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me outa the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister came back to business. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBelieve I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d increase the size\\r\\nof the shots, Tom. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in pretty hard rock right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were running the tunnel at the narrowest point of the hogback,\\r\\nwhich rose at a sharp angle. The snows began before it was more than\\r\\nhalf finished. Not willing to risk being cut off from supplies,\\r\\nHollister had enough staples hauled in to last him till he would be\\r\\nthrough. What needs might come up unexpectedly could be met by packers\\r\\ncoming in over the drifts from the dam.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Prowers had not shown his hand. Hollister began to think him less\\r\\ndangerous than he had supposed. The big bore grew longer every day. In\\r\\na few weeks it would be finished. Surely the cattleman would not wait\\r\\nto strike until after the job was done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nA STERN CHASE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clean bracing air of the Rockies, together with hard work and\\r\\nplenty of it, had poured new life into the blood of Tug Hollister. The\\r\\nashen, pasty look had been replaced on his face by a coat of healthy\\r\\nbrown. The fierce, driving headaches had gone, but there were still\\r\\nhours when the craving for the drug possessed him and sent him tramping\\r\\nthrough the night to fight the depression that swept in waves through\\r\\nhis heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter settled over the hills. The wind roared along the slope of the\\r\\ndivide and drove before it great scudding clouds heavily laden with\\r\\nmoisture. Storms fought and screamed around the peaks. Snow fell day\\r\\nafter day. It packed in the gulches and drifted into the draws. The\\r\\nlandscape became a vast snowfield across which the bitter winds drove\\r\\nand flung themselves at the flapping tents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came, too, nights of wonderful stillness broken only by the\\r\\ncrackling of branches in the cold, nights when the stars were out in\\r\\nmyriads and the white valley was a vast open-air cathedral built and\\r\\ndecorated by the Master Hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such a night Hollister turned in and slept till the small hours. He\\r\\nwoke, to find himself restless and irritable, the craving for the drug\\r\\nstrong on him. His chance of further sleep was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout lighting a lantern, he pulled on his heavy wool socks, his o.d.\\r\\nbreeches, and his fourteen-inch Chippewa pattern boots. His groping\\r\\nfingers found a leather vest with corduroy sleeves. Outside, he\\r\\nfastened on his skis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the night the weather had changed. It had come on to snow.\\r\\nThe flakes were large and few, but experience told the engineer that\\r\\nsoon they would be coming thick enough. He put on a slicker before he\\r\\nstarted on his tramp.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncertain which way to go, he stood for a moment outside the flap of\\r\\nthe tent. The rim of the saucer-shaped valley lay straight ahead.\\r\\nBeyond were the great white snow wastes, stretching mile on mile,\\r\\nisolating the little camp more effectually than a quarantine. He\\r\\ndecided to climb out of the draw and push across the hilltops.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo his ears came a faint slithering sound. He listened, heard it again.\\r\\nThe crunching of a ski on crusted snow! Who could be out at this time\\r\\nof night? Why? For what purpose?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was probably one of the men, he reflected. But none of them would\\r\\nbe on skis to move over the beaten paths around the camp. Some sixth\\r\\nsense warned of danger in the vicinity. He crept around the tent in the\\r\\ndirection from which the sound had come. His glance took in the other\\r\\ntents, scarcely visible against the background of white in the dim\\r\\nlight of pre-dawn. Everything there was still and silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain there came to him the hiss of a ski. A hundred yards distant\\r\\nwas the mouth of the tunnel. A moving figure stood out, black against\\r\\nthe pale background. Some one who had obviously just emerged from the\\r\\ntunnel was shuffling away through the snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister did not shout an order to halt. Instinctively he knew that\\r\\nsomething was wrong, and already he was bending to his stride. Before\\r\\nhe had taken half a dozen steps the head of the other man swung round\\r\\nhurriedly. Instantly the unknown quickened his pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they had traveled a hundred yards, Hollister knew he was more\\r\\nexpert in the use of the runners than the fugitive. Barring accidents\\r\\nhe would catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pursued man made for the rim of the valley. From time to time\\r\\nhe turned without stopping to see whether he was losing ground. The\\r\\ndistance between the two was lessening. Hollister knew it. Evidently\\r\\nthe other knew it, too, for he tried desperately to increase his pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hundred yards had become seventy-five, fifty, twenty-five. They\\r\\nwere out of the valley now, swinging toward the left where a patch of\\r\\ntimber lay back of a clump of quaking asps. A pile of boulders were\\r\\nhuddled beneath a rock-rim a stone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s throw to the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow was falling more heavily now. It was plain that the fugitive\\r\\nwas hoping to reach the timber and escape in the thickening storm. To\\r\\nprevent this, Hollister worked farther to the left. He came up quickly\\r\\nwith the other and passed him fifteen yards or less away.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gun cracked. Hollister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long stride did not slacken. He was keeping\\r\\nwell away because he had known the other would be armed. The engineer\\r\\nhad made a serious mistake in not stopping to get his revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the revolver sounded. The bullet flew harmlessly past. Tug had\\r\\ncircled ahead of his prey and cut him off from the grove of quaking\\r\\nasps. He was relying on a piece of audacity to protect him from the\\r\\narmed man. The stranger would assume that he, too, was armed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently this was the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasoning. He swung to the right, making\\r\\nfor the refuge of the rocks. Presently he glanced back to see if he was\\r\\nfollowed and how closely. The end of the ski must have caught under\\r\\na rock beneath the snow, for the man was flung forward to his face.\\r\\nThe binder of a ski had broken. He rose quickly, caught up the long\\r\\nsnowshoe, and ran forward at a gait between a hobble and a shuffle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug did not pursue directly. He had no desire to stop any of the\\r\\nbullets left in the chambers of the revolver. Instead of taking the\\r\\ntrail made for him, he broke a new one that led to the summit of the\\r\\nrock-rim above the boulder bed. There was a chance that in doing this\\r\\nhe might lose his man, but it was a chance that had to be taken. His\\r\\nguess was that the refugee would find a hiding-place in the rocks and\\r\\nwould stay there long enough, at any rate, to mend the broken strings\\r\\nof the ski.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the rock-rim Hollister looked down upon the boulder bed through\\r\\nthe thick snow. He made out a crouched figure below. Satisfied that his\\r\\nvictim was not still traveling, he examined the terrain to work out a\\r\\nplan of campaign. A heavy snow comb yawned above the rock-rim. This\\r\\nmight very well serve his purpose. Using one of his skis as a lever,\\r\\nhe loosened the heavy pack of snow. It moved at first very slowly, but\\r\\nwent at last with a rush. There was a roar as it plunged over the bluff\\r\\nand tore a way down to the rocks below. The slide gathered momentum as\\r\\nit went.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister peered down. The crouched figure was gone, had been buried in\\r\\nthe giant billow of white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer refastened his ski, took a few swinging strokes forward,\\r\\nand came to a smooth incline. Down this he coasted rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buried man was just struggling out of the white mass when a hand\\r\\nclosed on his coat collar. It dragged him from the pack and held him\\r\\nfirmly down. Not till Tug made sure that the revolver was missing did\\r\\nhe let the man rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWot\\xe2\\x80\\x99ell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eatin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 youse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the rescued man growled, snarling at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug Hollister stood face to face with the tramp he knew by the name of\\r\\nCig. Recognition was simultaneous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat were you doing at my camp?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAw, go chase yoreself. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been near your camp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your story. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go back there now. The sheriff\\r\\nwants you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evil face of the crook worked. Out of the corner of his twisted\\r\\nmouth he spoke venomously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, if I had my gun I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d croak youse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it. Get busy. Dig out your skis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 doing. Dig \\xe2\\x80\\x99em yoreself if youse want \\xe2\\x80\\x99em.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister knew of only one argument that would be effective with this\\r\\nproduct of New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underworld. He used it, filled with disgust\\r\\nbecause circumstances forced his hand. When Cig could endure no longer,\\r\\nhe gave way sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Nuff. But some day I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get you right for this. I aimed to bump you\\r\\noff, anyhow. Now I soitainly will. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forgot you rapped on me to\\r\\nthat guy Reed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve told you once I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, and you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe me. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let it\\r\\ngo at that. Now get those skis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snowshoes were rescued and the broken one mended. Hollister watched\\r\\nhis prisoner every minute of the time. He did not intend to run the\\r\\nrisk of being hit in the head by a bit of broken rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two moved down into the valley, Cig breaking trail. He made excuses\\r\\nthat he was dead tired and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go another step. They did not\\r\\nserve him well. His captor would not let the crook get in his rear for\\r\\na single second. He knew that, if the fellow got a chance, he would\\r\\nmurder him without the least hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a blinding snowstorm the two men reached camp. Twice Cig had tried\\r\\nto bolt and twice had been caught and punished. This was a degrading\\r\\nbusiness, but the engineer had no choice. It was necessary to bring the\\r\\nman in because he had been up to some deviltry, and Hollister could not\\r\\nlet him go without first finding out what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took him into his own tent and put him through a searching quiz.\\r\\nThe result of it was precisely nothing. Cig jeered at him defiantly.\\r\\nIf he could prove anything against him, let him go to it. That was the\\r\\nsubstance of the New Yorker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll turn you over to Clint Reed. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got something to say\\r\\nto you for stealing his little girl. From the way he talked, I judge\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in for a bad time of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig protested. He hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stolen the girl. How did they know he had? Who\\r\\nsaid so? What would he do a crazy thing like that for? To all of which\\r\\nHollister said calmly that he would have to explain that to Reed. If he\\r\\ncould satisfy the cattleman, it would be all right with him. Reed could\\r\\npass him on to Sheriff Daniels without further delay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a heluva pardner, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t youse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered the crook with an ugly\\r\\nlift of his upper lip. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cT\\xe2\\x80\\x99row me down foist chance youse get.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not your partner. We hit different trails the day we left the\\r\\nDiamond Bar K ranch. You needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play baby on me. That won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy you\\r\\nanything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGonna turn me over to Reed, then, are youse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve no time to bother with you. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll know how to handle the case.\\r\\nBetter that way, I reckon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig said nothing. For half an hour there was silence in the tent.\\r\\nHollister knew that his threat was sinking in, that the kidnapper was\\r\\nuneasily examining the situation to find the best way out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaylight came, and with it signs of activity around the camp. Smoke\\r\\npoured out of the stovepipe projecting from the chuck tent. Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvoices sounded. At last the beating of an iron on the triangle summoned\\r\\nthem to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll eat before we start,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99 want nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to eat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled the prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDifferent here. I do. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come along, anyhow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men at breakfast looked with surprise at the guest of the boss when\\r\\nhe appeared. Hollister explained what he was doing there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to go into the tunnel and have a look around before any of you\\r\\ndo any work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis fellow was up to some mischief, and I\\r\\nwant to find out what it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palate went dry. He knew better than they did in what a\\r\\npredicament he had put himself. If he let the thing go through as\\r\\noriginally intended, these men would never let him reach a sheriff. If\\r\\nhe confessed--what would they do to him?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate mechanically and yet voraciously, for the exercise of the night\\r\\nhad left him hungry. But every moment his mind was sifting the facts of\\r\\nthe case for an out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister rose to leave. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake care of this fellow till I get back,\\r\\nTom. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he was up to, but if anything happens to me,\\r\\nrush him right down to Daniels.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will--in a pig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman answered bluntly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf anything\\r\\nhappens to you, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give this bird his, muy pronto.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer was lifting the flap of the tent when Cig spoke huskily\\r\\nfrom a parched throat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go along wid youse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Not the least change of expression in his face showed that\\r\\nHollister knew he had won, knew he had broken down the fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stiff\\r\\nand sullen resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig shuffled beside Tug to the tunnel. The months had made a difference\\r\\nin the bearing of the ex-service man. When the New Yorker had met him\\r\\nfirst, Hollister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mental attitude found expression in the way he\\r\\nwalked. He was a tramp, in clothes, in spirit, in habit of life, and in\\r\\nthe way he carried his body. The shoulders drooped, the feet dragged,\\r\\nthe expression of the face was cynical. Since then there had been relit\\r\\nin him the spark of self-respect. He was a new man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped aside, to let Cig pass first into the tunnel. At the\\r\\nentrance he lit two candles and handed one to his prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did you want to come for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you something to show\\r\\nme? Or something to tell me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig moved forward. He spoke over his shoulder, protecting the candle\\r\\nwith one hand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust a bit of a lark. Thought I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d throw a scare into\\r\\nyore men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former convict continued through the tunnel to the face of the rock\\r\\nwall. He set his candle down on a niche of jutting sandstone. With his\\r\\nfingers he scraped away some sand from the ragged wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice was sharp. He held out his hand.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom beneath the sand Cig had taken a stick of dynamite. He dug up five\\r\\nothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object of putting them there was plain enough. If a workman\\r\\nhad struck any one of them with a pick, there would have been an\\r\\nexplosion, and the sand beds round the rocks were precisely the places\\r\\ninto which the pick points would have gone. The thing had been a\\r\\ndeliberate attempt at cold-blooded wholesale murder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure you have them all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep. Had only six.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added, with a whine: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aim to hurt any o\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nthe boys, but only to scare \\xe2\\x80\\x99em some.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer made no comment. He drove his prisoner before him back\\r\\ninto the light. Tom met him at the entrance to the tunnel. The foreman\\r\\nexamined the sticks of dynamite, listened to what Hollister had to say,\\r\\nand jerked his head toward Cig.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fix him right so\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never pull another trick like\\r\\nthis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told his chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d opposed Hollister. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing of that sort, Tom. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take\\r\\nhim down to the sheriff. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll send him over the road.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike blazes we will!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foreman burst out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happened\\r\\nto see him this morning, three or four of us might be dead by now.\\r\\nHanging\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too good for this guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed Tug. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to put ourselves in the wrong\\r\\nbecause he is. The law will deal with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe boys ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t liable to feel that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tom said significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything about it till we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell them\\r\\nthen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His hand fell on the foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulder with a grip that was\\r\\nalmost affectionate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a lynching here, Tom. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be the\\r\\nones in bad then.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTom had to feel his way through a few moments of sulkiness to\\r\\nacceptance of this point of view. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the doctor.\\r\\nHustle this fellow outa camp an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll wait till you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gone. Sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npicked up every stick of this stuff?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig was quite sure about that. He spoke humbly and with all the\\r\\nbraggadocio gone from his manner. He had been thoroughly frightened and\\r\\ndid not yet feel wholly out of the woods. Not till he was behind the\\r\\nbars would he feel quite safe again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nOUT OF THE BLIZZARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTom called a warning to Hollister as the engineer and his prisoner\\r\\nstruck out into the blinding storm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCareful you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get lost. Looks\\r\\nlike she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 her back up for a reg\\xe2\\x80\\x99lar snifter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow was still falling thickly, but it had behind it now a driving\\r\\nwind that slapped it in the faces of the men at a slanting angle.\\r\\nPresently under the lee of a hill they got their backs to the storm,\\r\\nbut this did not greatly improve conditions, for the whip of the wind\\r\\ncaught up the surface drifts and whirled them at the travelers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister had buckled on a belt with a revolver and had taken the\\r\\nprecaution to rope his prisoner to him with ten feet of slack between.\\r\\nThey ploughed through the new snow that had fallen above the crust,\\r\\nmaking slow progress even with the wind to help.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the shelter of the gulch they came into the full force of the\\r\\nhowling hurricane. It caught them as they crossed a mesa leading to\\r\\na ca\\xc3\\xb1on. Hollister realized that the snow was thinning, but the wind\\r\\nwas rising and the temperature falling. He did not like that. Even to\\r\\nhis lack of experience there was the feel of a blizzard in the air.\\r\\nMoreover, before they were halfway across the mesa he had a sense of\\r\\nhaving lost his direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig dropped back, whining. This was an adventure wholly out of his\\r\\nline. He was game enough in his way, but bucking blizzards was not one\\r\\nof the things he had known in his city-cramped experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe gotta go back. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get us sure if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug would have turned back gladly enough if he had known which way to\\r\\ngo, but in the swirl of white that enveloped them he did not know east\\r\\nfrom west. The thing to do, he judged, was to strike as straight a line\\r\\nas possible. This ought to take them off the mesa to the shelter of\\r\\nsome draw or wooded ravine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be better when we get where the wind can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slam across the open\\r\\nat us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the moment at least the former convict was innocuous. He was wholly\\r\\npreoccupied with the battle against the storm. Tug took the lead and\\r\\nbroke trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whirling snow stung his face like burning sand. His skis clogged\\r\\nwith the weight of the drifts. Each dragging step gave him the sense of\\r\\nlifting a leaden ball chained to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig went down, whimpering. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m all in!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shrieked through the noise\\r\\nof the screaming blasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cForget it, man!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister dragged him to his feet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you quit now\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re done for. Keep coming. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get off this mesa soon. It can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nfar now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was none too confident himself. Stories came to his mind of men who\\r\\nhad wandered round and round in a circle till the blizzard had taken\\r\\ntoll of their vitality and claimed them for its own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner sank down again and had to be dragged out of the drift\\r\\ninto which he had fallen. Five or six times the taut rope stopped Tug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nprogress. Somehow he cheered and bullied the worn-out man to the edge\\r\\nof the mesa, down a sharp slope, and into the wind-break of a young\\r\\ngrove of pines.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the snow Cig dropped helplessly. The hinges of his knees\\r\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hold him any longer. His expression reminded Hollister of the\\r\\nfrightened face of a child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 west,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot this trip,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer told him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuck up and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make it\\r\\nfine. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know this country, do you? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at the mouth of a gulch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig looked around. In front of him was a twisted pine that looked like\\r\\nan umbrella blown inside out. He recognized it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis gulch leads into another. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cabin in it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\nheluva long ways from here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better get started,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe cabin won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come to\\r\\nus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave the Bowery tough a hand to help him to his feet. Cig pulled\\r\\nhimself up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever get there in the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he complained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell you I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe staggered into the drifts after his leader. The bitter wind and cold\\r\\nsearched through their clothing to freeze the life out of them. At the\\r\\nend of a long slow two hundred yards, the weaker man quit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister came back to him. He lay huddled on the newly broken trail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ordered Tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 doing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m through. Go on an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 leave me if youse want to, you\\r\\nbig stiff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last flare of defiance. He collapsed into himself,\\r\\nhelpless as a boxer counted out in the roped ring. Hollister tugged at\\r\\nhim, cuffed him, scolded, and encouraged. None of these seemed even to\\r\\nreach his consciousness. He lay inert, even the will to live beaten out\\r\\nof him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that moment, while Hollister stood there considering, buffeted by\\r\\nthe howling wind and the sting of the pelting sleet, he saw at his\\r\\nfeet a brother whose life must be saved and not an outlaw and potential\\r\\nmurderer. He could not leave Cig, even to save himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teeth fastened to one end of a mitten. He dragged it from his\\r\\nhand. Half-frozen fingers searched in his pocket for a knife and found\\r\\nit. They could not open the blade, and he did this, too, with his\\r\\nteeth. Then, dropping to one knee awkwardly, he sawed at the thongs\\r\\nwhich fastened the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skis. They were coated with ice, but he\\r\\nmanaged to sever them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the supine body and ploughed forward up the gulch. The\\r\\nhope he nursed was a cold and forlorn one. He did not know the ca\\xc3\\xb1on\\r\\nor how far it was to the gulch in which the cabin was. By mistake he\\r\\nmight go wandering up a draw which led nowhere. Or he might drop in his\\r\\ntracks from sheer exhaustion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was a fighter. It was not in him to give up. He had to stagger\\r\\non, to crawl forward, to drag his burden after him when he could not\\r\\ncarry it. His teeth were set fast, clinched with the primal instinct to\\r\\ngo through with it as long as he could edge an inch toward his goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gulch opened out of the ca\\xc3\\xb1on. Into it he turned, head down against\\r\\na wind that hit him like a wall. The air, thick with sifted ice,\\r\\nintensely cold, sapped the warmth and vitality of his body. His numbed\\r\\nlegs doubled under the weight of him as though hinged. He was down and\\r\\nup again and down, but the call of life still drove him. Automatically\\r\\nhe clung to his helpless load as though it were a part of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the furious gray flurry a cabin detached itself. He weaved a\\r\\ncrooked path toward it, reached the wall, crept along the logs to a\\r\\ndoor. Against this he plunged forward, reaching for the latch blindly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door gave, and he pitched to the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lay there, conscious, but with scarcely energy enough of mind or\\r\\nbody to register impressions. A fire roared up the chimney. He knew\\r\\nthat. Some one rose with an exclamation of amazement at his intrusion.\\r\\nThere was a hiatus of time. His companion of the adventure, still tied\\r\\nto him, lay on the floor. A man was stooping over Cig, busy with the\\r\\nremoval of his ice-coated garments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man cut the rope. Hollister crawled closer to the fire. He\\r\\nunfastened the slicker and flung it aside. If he had not lost his\\r\\nknife, he would have cut the thongs of the skis. Instead, he thrust his\\r\\nfeet close to the red glow to thaw out the ice-knots that had gathered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was exhausted from the fight through the deep drifts, but he was not\\r\\nphysically in a bad way. A few hours\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sleep would be all he needed to\\r\\nset him right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake a nip of this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a squeaky voice advised.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister turned his head quickly. He looked into the leathery face and\\r\\nskim-milk eyes of Jake Prowers. It would be hard to say which of them\\r\\nwas the more startled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy jiminy by jinks, if it ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the smart-aleck hobo engineer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\ncattleman announced to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs he alive?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Tug, nodding toward the man on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe all right in a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while. His eyes flickered when I gave him a\\r\\ndrink. How\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you come here, anyhow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGot lost in the storm. He played out. Had to drag him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug rubbed his\\r\\nhands together to restore circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMean you got lost an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 just happened in here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHmp! Better be born lucky than with brains, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say. What were you\\r\\ndoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out in the blizzard? Where you headed for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was taking him to Wild Horse--to the sheriff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA mask dropped over the eyes of the little cattleman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhe been doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wanted for shooting Mr. Reed and firing his wheatfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou been appointed deputy sheriff since you took to playin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 good?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd for other things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer added, as though Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sneer\\r\\nhad not been uttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeanin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKidnapping Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo proof of that a-tall. Anything more?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes of the two met and grew chill. Hollister knew that the rancher\\r\\nwas feeling out the ground. He wanted to find out what had taken place\\r\\nto-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat more could there be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug asked quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither relaxed the rigor of his gaze. In the light-blue orbs of the\\r\\nolder was an expression cold and cruel, almost unhuman, indefinably\\r\\nmenacing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClaims I was tryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to blow up his mine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The voice came from behind\\r\\nProwers. It was faint and querulous. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m froze up inside. Gimme a\\r\\ndrink, Jake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers passed the bottle over. He continued to look at the uninvited\\r\\nguest who knew too much. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowcome you to get that notion about him\\r\\nblowin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up yore tunnel?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaught him at it. Dragged him back and made him show where he had put\\r\\nthe sticks of powder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister answered grimly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou interested in\\r\\nthis, Mr. Prowers?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome. Why not? Got to be neighborly, haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The high voice had\\r\\nfallen to a soft purr. It came to Hollister, with a cold swift patter\\r\\nof mice feet down his spine, that he was in deadly danger. Nobody knew\\r\\nhe was here, except these two men. Cig had only to give it out that\\r\\nthey had become separated in the blizzard. They could, unless he was\\r\\nable to protect himself, murder him and dispose of the body in entire\\r\\nsafety. If reports were true, Prowers was an adept at that kind of\\r\\nsinister business. Tug had, of course, a revolver, but he knew that the\\r\\ncattleman could beat him to the draw whenever he chose. The old man was\\r\\na famous shot. He would take his time. He would make sure before he\\r\\nstruck. The blow would fall when his victim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wariness relaxed, at the\\r\\nmoment when he was least expecting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug knew that neither of these two in the room with him had any regard\\r\\nfor the sanctity of human life. There are such people, a few among many\\r\\nmillions, essentially feral, untouched by any sense of common kinship\\r\\nin the human race. Prowers would be moved by one consideration only.\\r\\nWould it pay to obliterate him? The greatest factor in the strength\\r\\nof the cattleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position was that men regarded him with fear and\\r\\nawe. The disappearance of Hollister would stir up whisperings and\\r\\nsuspicions. Others would read the obvious lesson. Daunted, they would\\r\\nsidestep the old man rather than oppose him. Yet no proof could be\\r\\nfound to establish definitely a crime, or at any rate to connect him\\r\\nwith it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of the Sweetwater Dam project meant more to Prowers than\\r\\ndollars and cents. His power and influence in the neighborhood were at\\r\\nstake, and it was for these that he lived. If the irrigation project\\r\\nshould be successful, it would bring about a change in the character\\r\\nof the country. Settlers would pour in, farm the Flat Tops, and gobble\\r\\nup the remnants of the open range. To the new phase of cattle-raising\\r\\nthat must develop, he was unalterably opposed. He had no intention, if\\r\\nhe could prevent it, of seeing Paradise Valley dominated by other men\\r\\nand other ways. The development of the land would make Clint Reed bulk\\r\\nlarger in the county; it would inevitably push Jake into the background\\r\\nand make of him a minor figure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent this, Prowers would stick at nothing. Hollister was only a\\r\\nsubordinate, but his death would serve excellently to point a sinister\\r\\nmoral. If more important persons did not take warning, they, too, might\\r\\nvanish from the paths of the living.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re neighborly enough, even if you visited us by deputy this\\r\\nmorning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister answered, level gaze fixed on the cattleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid I visit you by deputy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jake asked, gently ironical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? One with six sticks of dynamite to help us on the job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNews to me. How about it, Cig? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yore smart-aleck friend drivin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig had crept forward to the fire and lay crouched on the hearth. His\\r\\ntwitching face registered the torture of a circulation beginning to\\r\\nnormalize itself again in frozen hands and feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaid he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d turn me over to that guy Reed. Took advantage of me while I\\r\\nwas played out to beat me up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snarled the city tough. He finished with\\r\\na string of vile epithets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe splenetic laughter of the cattleman cackled out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nto take Cig here down to Daniels with that cock-an\\xe2\\x80\\x99-bull story you\\r\\ncooked up. Is that the play?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take him down--now or later.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis appeared to amuse the little man. His cracked laughter sounded\\r\\nagain. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow or later, by jimmy by jinks. My hobo friend, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d lived\\r\\nin this country long as I have, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gamble heavy on that\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98later.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d read yore Bible proper, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d know that man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s days\\r\\nare as grass, which withers up considerable an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sudden. Things happen\\r\\nin this world of woe right onexpected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug did not dodge this covert threat. He dragged it into the open.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat could happen to me now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re safe out of the storm, Mr. Prowers?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skim-milk eyes did not change expression, but there seemed to lie\\r\\nback of them the jeer of mockery. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, \\xe2\\x80\\x99most anything. We eat canned\\r\\ntomatoes for supper, say--an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you get lead poisonin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known real\\r\\nhealthy-lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 folks fall asleep an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 never wake up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister agreed, an odd sinking in the pit of his\\r\\nstomach. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen murderers who could have passed a first-class\\r\\nlife insurance examination quit living very suddenly. The other day I\\r\\nread a piece about a scoundrel in Mexico who had killed two or three\\r\\npeople. He rather had the habit. When he shot another in the back, his\\r\\nneighbors rode to his ranch one night and hanged him to his own wagon\\r\\ntongue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always did say Mexico was no place for a white man to live,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the old\\r\\nfellow piped amiably. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I expect you boys are hungry, buckin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 this\\r\\nblizzard. What say to some dinner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood enough. No canned tomatoes, though, if you please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more Hollister and Prowers measured eyes before the cattleman\\r\\ngrinned evilly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlad you mentioned it. I was aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to have tomatoes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCOME ON, YOU DAMN BUSHWHACKER\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fury of the storm rattled the window panes. Down the chimney came\\r\\nthe shrill whistle of the gale. The light of day broke dimly through\\r\\nthe heavy clouds that swept above the gulch from peak to peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the men sitting at dinner in the cabin watched each other\\r\\nintently if covertly. The third, dog-tired, nodded over the food he\\r\\nrushed voraciously to his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGonna pound my ear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig announced as soon as he had finished eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe threw himself on a bunk and inside of five minutes was snoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug, too, wanted to sleep. The desire of it grew on him with the\\r\\npassing hours. Overtaxed nature demanded a chance to recuperate.\\r\\nInstead, the young man drank strong coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nJake Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shrill little voice asked mildly, with the hint of a\\r\\ncackle in it, if he was not tired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the middle of the day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Tug, stifling a yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlad you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be comp\\xe2\\x80\\x99ny for each other. Storm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npeterin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out, looks like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed the guest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was. Except for occasional gusts, the wind had died away. Tug\\r\\nconsidered the possibility of leaving before night fell. But if he\\r\\nleft, where could he go in the gathering darkness? Would Prowers let\\r\\nhim walk safely away? Or would a declaration of his intention to go\\r\\nbring an immediate showdown? Even so, better fight the thing out now,\\r\\nwhile he was awake and Cig asleep, than wait until he slipped into\\r\\ndrowsiness that would give the little spider-man his chance to strike\\r\\nand kill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug had no longer any doubt of his host\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intention. Under a thin\\r\\ndisguise he saw the horrible purpose riding every word and look. It\\r\\nwould be soon now. Why not choose his own time and try to get the break\\r\\nof the draw?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not do it. Neither will nor muscles would respond to the\\r\\nlogical conviction of his mind that he was entitled to any advantage\\r\\nhe could get. To whip out his gun and fire might be fair. He had no\\r\\ntrouble in deciding that it was. But if luck were with him--if he came\\r\\nout alive from the duel--how could he explain why he had shot down\\r\\nwithout warning the man who was sheltering him from the blizzard? For\\r\\nthat matter, how could he justify it to himself in the years to come?\\r\\nA moral certainty was not enough. He must wait until he _knew_, until\\r\\nthe old killer made that lightning move which would give him just the\\r\\nvantage-ground Tug was denying himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that Tug could do was watch him, every nerve keyed and muscle\\r\\ntensed, or bring the struggle to immediate issue. He came, suddenly,\\r\\nclearly, to the end of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTime I was going,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and his voice rang clear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoing where?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand stopped caressing his unshaven chin and\\r\\nfell, almost too casually, to his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey glared at each other, tense, crouched, eyes narrowed and\\r\\nunwinking. Duels are fought and lost in that preliminary battle of\\r\\nlocked eyes which precedes the short, sharp stabbings of the cartridge\\r\\nexplosions. Soul searches soul for the temper of the foe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither gaze wavered. Each found the other stark, indomitable. The odds\\r\\nwere heavily in favor of the old cattleman. He was a practiced gunman.\\r\\nQuicker than the eye could follow would come the upsweep of his arm. He\\r\\ncould fire from the hip without taking aim. Nobody in the county could\\r\\nempty a revolver faster than he. But the younger man had one advantage.\\r\\nHe had disarranged Prowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plans by taking the initiative, by forcing\\r\\nthe killer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand. This was unexpected. It disturbed Jake the least in\\r\\nthe world. His opponents usually dodged a crisis that would lead to\\r\\nconflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold blast beat into the house. In the open doorway stood a man, the\\r\\nrange rider Black. Both men stared at him silently. Each knew that his\\r\\ncoming had changed the conditions of the equation.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the blue cheek of the newcomer a quid of tobacco stood out. It\\r\\nwas impossible to tell from his impassive face how much or how little\\r\\nof the situation he guessed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRan outa smokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThought I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d drap over an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 have you loan\\r\\nme the makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had closed the door. Now he shuffled forward to the fire and with a\\r\\ncharred stick knocked the snow from his webs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA sure enough rip-snorter, if any one asks you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued mildly\\r\\nby way of comment on the weather. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know as I recall any storm\\r\\nwuss while it lasted. I seen longer ones, unless this \\xe2\\x80\\x99un \\xe2\\x80\\x99s jest\\r\\ngatherin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 second wind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug drew a deep breath of relief and eased down. Red tragedy had been\\r\\nhovering in the gathering shadows of the room. It was there no longer.\\r\\nThe blessed homely commonplace of life had entered with the lank\\r\\nhomesteader and his need of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot fur from my place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black went on, ignoring the silence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbe dawg-goned if it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x99most all I could do to break through the\\r\\ndrifts. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 known it was so bad I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m blamed if I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nstayed right by my own fireside an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 read that book my sister give me\\r\\ntwenty-odd years ago. Its a right good book, I been told, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I been\\r\\nwaitin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 till I broke my laig to read it. Funny about that, too. The\\r\\nonly time I ever bust my laig an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 got stove up proper was \\xe2\\x80\\x99way down on\\r\\nWild Cat Creek. The doc kep\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me flat on a bunk three weeks, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that\\r\\nbook \\xe2\\x80\\x98David Coppermine\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a whole day away from me up in the hills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavid Copperfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suggested Tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, too. But it sure fooled me when I looked into it onct.\\r\\nIt ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got a thing to do with the Butte mines or the Arizona ones\\r\\nneither. Say, Jake, what about that tobacco? Can you lend me the loan\\r\\nof a sack?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers pointed to a shelf above the table. He was annoyed at Black. It\\r\\nwas like his shiftlessness not to keep enough tobacco on hand. Of all\\r\\nthe hours in the year, why should he butt in at precisely this one? He\\r\\nwas confoundedly in the way. The cattleman knew that he could not go\\r\\non with this thing now. Don was not thoroughgoing enough. He would do\\r\\na good many things outside the law, but they had to conform to his own\\r\\npeculiar code. He had joined in the cattle stampede only after being\\r\\npersuaded that nobody would be hurt by it. Since then Jake had not felt\\r\\nthat he was dependable. The homesteader was suffering from an attack of\\r\\nconscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig had wakened when the rush of cold air from the open door had swept\\r\\nacross the room. He sat up now, yawning and stretching himself awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a Gawd-forsaken country!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he jeered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe for de bright lights of\\r\\nli\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ol\\xe2\\x80\\x99 New York. If Cig ever lands in de Grand Central, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stick\\r\\nright on de island, b\\xe2\\x80\\x99lieve me. I wisht I was at Mike\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Place right dis\\r\\nminute. A skoit hangs out dere who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stuck on yours truly. Some dame,\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell de world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And he launched into a disreputable reminiscence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody echoed his laughter. Hollister was disgusted. Black did not like\\r\\nthe tramp. The brain of Prowers was already spinning a cobweb of plots.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig looked round. What was the matter with these boobs, anyhow? Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthey know a good story when they heard one?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, wot\\xe2\\x80\\x99ell is dis--a Salvation Army dump before de music opens up?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe asked, with an insulting lift of the upper lip.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug strapped on his skis, always with an eye on Prowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich reminded Cig. A triumphant venom surged up in him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGonna take me down to de cop, are youse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he sneered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, will youse\\r\\nring for a taxi, Jake? I gotta go to jail wid dis bird.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two sentences Prowers gave his version of the story to Black. Tug\\r\\ncorrected him instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe came to blow us up in the tunnel. When I took him back, he dug six\\r\\nsticks of dynamite out of the dirt in the rock wall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack spat into the fire. His face reflected disgust, but he said\\r\\nnothing. What was there to say, except that his soul was sick of the\\r\\nevil into which he was being dragged by the man he accepted as leader?\\r\\n\\r\\nTug put on his slicker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere you going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo the camp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99S a long way. Better stay at my shack to-night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch obliged. I will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went out together. Tug was careful to walk with Black between him\\r\\nand the cabin as long as it was in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind had died completely, so that the air was no longer a white\\r\\nsmother. Travel was easy, for the cold had crusted the top of the snow.\\r\\nThey worked their way out of the gulch, crossed an edge of the forest\\r\\nreserve, and passed the cabin of the homesteader Howard. Not far from\\r\\nthis, Black turned into his own place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range rider kicked off his webs and replenished the fire. While he\\r\\nmade supper, Hollister sat on the floor before the glowing pi\\xc3\\xb1on knots\\r\\nand dried his skis. When they were thoroughly dry, he waxed them well,\\r\\nrubbing in the wax with a cork.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 get it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black called presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down to a meal of ham, potatoes, biscuits, plenty of gravy,\\r\\nand coffee. Tug did himself well. He had worked hard enough in the\\r\\ndrifts to justify a man-size hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir talk rambled in the casual fashion of haphazard conversation. It\\r\\ntouched on Jake Prowers and Cig, rather sketchily, for Black did not\\r\\ncare to discuss the men with whom he was still allied, no matter what\\r\\nhis private opinion of them might be. It included the tunnel and the\\r\\nchances of success of the Sweetwater Dam project, this last a matter\\r\\nupon which they differed. Don had spent his life in the saddle. He\\r\\nstuck doggedly to the contention that, since water will not run uphill,\\r\\nthe whole enterprise was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdawg-goned foolishness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister gave up, shrugging his shoulders. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right with me. A man\\r\\nconvinced against his will, you know. Trouble with you is that you\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the Flat Tops irrigated, so you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let yourself believe\\r\\nthey can be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Government engineers said they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be watered, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they?\\r\\nWell, their say-so goes with me all right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were wrong, but you needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it till you see water in the\\r\\nditches on Flat Top.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug rose from the table and expanded his lungs in a deep, luxurious\\r\\nyawn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll turn in and sleep round the clock if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind.\\r\\nI can hardly keep my eyes open.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack waved his hand at the nearest bunk. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was taking off his boots, the engineer came to a matter he\\r\\nwanted to get off his mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExpect you know the hole I was in when you\\r\\nshowed up this afternoon. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say I never was more glad to see anybody\\r\\nin my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat d\\xe2\\x80\\x99you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Black, blank wall eyes full on his guest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean that Prowers was watching for a chance to kill me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d called\\r\\nfor a showdown a moment before you opened the door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range rider lied, loyally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to that a-tall. What would Jake\\r\\nwant to do that for? Would it get him anything if he did? You sure\\r\\nfooled yoreself if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you were thinking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The eyes of the younger man were on Black, hard, keen, and\\r\\nintent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what I was thinking. And still am.\\r\\nSubject number two on which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to agree to disagree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJake\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no bad man runnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 around gunnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 men for to see \\xe2\\x80\\x99em kick. You\\r\\nbeen readin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 too much Billy the Kid stuff, I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wonder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug dropped the second boot on the floor and rose to take off his coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came the sound of a shot, the crash of breaking glass. Hollister\\r\\nswayed drunkenly on his feet, groped for the back of a chair, half\\r\\nturned, and slid to the floor beside the bunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movements were slow. Now no panther could have leaped\\r\\nfor the lamp more swiftly. He blew out the light, crept along the log\\r\\nwall to the window, reached out a hand cautiously, and drew a curtain\\r\\nacross the pane through which a bullet had just come. Then, crouching,\\r\\nhe ran across the room and took a rifle from the deer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horns upon\\r\\nwhich it rested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on, you damn bushwhacker. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ready for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\nA DIFFERENCE OF OPINION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty was whipping mayonnaise in the kitchen when a voice hailed the\\r\\nDiamond Bar K ranch in general.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello the house!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the window she saw a rider on a horse, and a moment later her\\r\\nbrain localized him as a neighborhood boy who had recently joined the\\r\\nforest rangers. She went to the door, sleeves still rolled back to the\\r\\nelbows of the firm satiny arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoo-hoo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she called, flinging a small hand wildly above her head in\\r\\ngreeting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoo-hoo, Billy boy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned, caught sight of her, and at once began to smile. It was\\r\\nnoticeable that when Betty laughed, as she frequently did for no good\\r\\nreason at all except a general state of well-being, others were likely\\r\\nto join in her happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, there you are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and at once descended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUmpha! Here I am, but I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be long. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m making salad dressing. Come\\r\\nin to the kitchen if you like. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you a cookie. Just out o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the\\r\\noven.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cListens good to Billy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and stayed not on the order of his\\r\\ncoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found him a plate of cookies and a stool. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit there. And tell me\\r\\nwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new in the hills. Did you pass the dam as you came down? And\\r\\nwhat d\\xe2\\x80\\x99you know about the tunnel?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranger stopped a cookie halfway to his mouth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, that\\r\\nfellow--the one drivin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the tunnel--he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been shot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast night--at Don Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold hand laid itself on her heart and stopped its beating. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nmean--on purpose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShot through the window at dark.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Hollister--that who you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what he calls himself now. Jones it was at first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs he--hurt badly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say so. In the side--internal injuries. Outa his head when I was\\r\\nthere this mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does the doctor say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen him yet. On the way up now. I \\xe2\\x80\\x99phoned down from\\r\\nMeagher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ranch. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ought to pass here soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they get the doctor sooner? What were they thinking\\r\\nabout?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody with him but Don Black. He couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave him alone, he claims.\\r\\nLucky I dropped in when I did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nImpulsively Betty made up her mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to him. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to\\r\\ntake me, Billy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the ranger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the big idea, Betty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone to Denver to the stock show. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to look after him.\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Dad would want if he were here. Some one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to nurse\\r\\nhim. What other woman can go in on snowshoes and do it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes he have to have a woman nurse? Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Mr. Merrick send a man up\\r\\nthere to look after him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t argue, Billy boy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see how it is. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\neven get a doctor to him for fifteen or sixteen hours. By this time\\r\\nhe may be--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She stopped and bit her lip to check a sudden swell of\\r\\nemotion that choked up her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBridget came into the kitchen. Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement was both a decision\\r\\nand an appeal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Hollister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been hurt--shot--up in the hills. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ngoing up to Justin to make him take me to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs he hur-rt bad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the buxom housekeeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Billy thinks so. If I hurry I can get there before\\r\\nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBridget hesitated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was thinkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it might be better for me to go,\\r\\ndearie. You know how folks talk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, talk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty was explosively impatient. She always was when\\r\\nanybody interfered with one of her enthusiasms. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, if you\\r\\ncould go. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never get in through the snow. And what could they\\r\\nsay--except that I went to save a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life if I could?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Merrick might not like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The girl was nobly indignant for her fianc\\xc3\\xa9.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he like it? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want me to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Under the\\r\\nbrown bloom of her cheeks was the peach glow of excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBridget had traveled some distance on the journey of life, and she\\r\\nhad her own opinion about that. Merrick, if she guessed him at all\\r\\ncorrectly, was a possessive man. He could appreciate Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s valiant\\r\\neagerness when it went out to him, but he would be likely to resent\\r\\nher generous giving of herself to another. He did not belong to the\\r\\ntype of lover that recognizes the right of a sweetheart or a wife to\\r\\nexpress herself in her own way. She was pledged to him. Her vocation\\r\\nand avocation in life were to be his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Bridget was wise in her generation. She knew that Betty was of the\\r\\ntemperament that had to learn from experience. She asked how they would\\r\\ntravel to the dam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn horseback--if we can get through. The road\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not broken yet\\r\\nprobably after yesterday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s storm. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start right away. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get\\r\\nJustin on the \\xe2\\x80\\x99phone. The wire must be down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranger saddled for her and they took the road. Betty carried with\\r\\nher a small emergency kit of medical supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravel back and forth had broken the road in the valley. It was not\\r\\nuntil the riders struck the hill trail that they had to buck drifts. It\\r\\nwas slow, wearing work, and, by the time they came in sight of the dam,\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s watch told her that it was two o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick saw them coming down the long white slope and wondered what\\r\\ntravelers had business urgent enough to bring them through heavy drifts\\r\\nto the isolated camp. As soon as he recognized Betty, he went to meet\\r\\nher. Billy rode on down to the tents. He knew when he was not needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRich color glowed in her cheeks, excitement sparkled in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat in the world are you doing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Merrick asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was the least bit dashed by his manner. It suggested censure,\\r\\nimplied that her adventure--whatever the cause of it--was a bit of\\r\\nheadstrong folly. Did he think it was a girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place to stay at home\\r\\nin weather like this? Did he think that she was unmaidenly, had bucked\\r\\nmiles of snowdrifts because she could not stay away from him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you heard about Mr. Hollister? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been hurt--shot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast night. At Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho shot him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty bad, Billy says.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoctor seen him yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the way now. I want you to take me to him, Justin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake _you_? What for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo nurse him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, the superior smile of one prepared to argue away the foolish\\r\\nfancies of a girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs your father home yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be back to-morrow. Why?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause, dear girl, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go farther. In the first place, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not\\r\\nnecessary. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do all that can be done for Hollister. The trip from\\r\\nhere won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a picnic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve brought my skis. I can get in all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she protested eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI grant that. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no need for you to go. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d far better not.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not quite--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He stopped in mid-sentence, with an expressive lift\\r\\nof the shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite proper. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect _you_ to say that, Justin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nreproached. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter what he did for us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did only what any self-respecting man would do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer smile coaxed him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I want to do only what any self-respecting\\r\\nwoman would do. Surely it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be all right if you go along.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could he tell her that he knew no other unmarried woman of her age,\\r\\noutside of professional nurses, who would consider such a thing for the\\r\\nsake of a comparative stranger? How could he make her see that Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncabin was no place for a young girl to stay? He was exasperated at her\\r\\npersistence. It offended his _amour propre_. Why all this discussion\\r\\nabout one of his employees who had been a tramp only a few months\\r\\nsince?\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick shook his head. His lips smiled, but there was no smile in his\\r\\neyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a very impulsive and very generous young woman. But if\\r\\nyou were a little older you would see--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe broke impatiently into his argument. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see how I feel,\\r\\nJustin? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do what I can for him. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not in a city where we\\r\\ncan ring up for a trained nurse. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only available woman that can\\r\\nget in to him. Why did I take my Red Cross training if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not to help\\r\\nthose who are sick?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you trust me to look out for him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I can. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the point. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much in nursing.\\r\\nAny doctor will tell you so. Maybe he needs expert care. I really can\\r\\nnurse. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it all my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect to nurse everybody in the county that falls sick, do\\r\\nyou? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see, dear girl, that Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shack is no place for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a ranchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shock or offend\\r\\nme to see things that might distress a city girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She cast about in\\r\\nher mind for another way to put it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember my mother leaving us\\r\\nonce for days to look after a homesteader who had been hurt \\xe2\\x80\\x99way up on\\r\\nRabbit Ear Creek. Why, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what all the women on the frontier did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe frontier days are past,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beside the point,\\r\\nanyhow. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have him well looked after. You needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I would,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she urged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d worry a lot. I want to go myself,\\r\\nJustin--to make sure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right and that everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being done\\r\\nfor him that can be. You think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just foolishness in me, but it\\r\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her hand shyly on his sleeve. The gesture was an appeal for\\r\\nunderstanding of the impulse that was urgent in her. If he could only\\r\\nsympathize with it and acknowledge its obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neither necessary nor wise. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my duty, not yours,\\r\\nto have him nursed properly. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not shirk it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He spoke with the\\r\\nfinality of a dominant man who has made up his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty felt thrown back on herself. She was disappointed in him and her\\r\\nfeelings were hurt. Why must he be so obtuse, so correct and formal?\\r\\nWhy couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he see that she _had_ to go? After all, a decision as to\\r\\nwhat course she would follow lay with her and not with him. He had no\\r\\nright to assume otherwise. She was determined to go, anyhow, but she\\r\\nwould not quarrel with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen are you going up to Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo take me, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t best, dear girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her heart flamed smokily rebellious fires. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go with Billy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe interpreted the words as a challenge. Their eyes met in a long,\\r\\nsteady look. Each measured the strength of the other. It was the first\\r\\ntime they had come into open conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that, Betty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how I feel about it. You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her voice\\r\\nshook with emotion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve _got_ to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick knew that he could prevent the ranger from guiding Betty to the\\r\\ngulch where the wounded man was, but it was possible to pay too great a\\r\\nprice for victory. He yielded, grudgingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take you. After you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen Hollister, you can give us directions\\r\\nfor nursing him. I should think the doctor ought to know, but, if you\\r\\nhaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t confidence in him, you can see to it yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty found no pleasure now in her desire to help. Justin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opposition\\r\\nhad taken all the joy out of it. Nor did his surrender give her any\\r\\ngratification. He had not yielded because he appreciated the validity\\r\\nof her purpose, but because he had chosen to avoid an open breach. She\\r\\nfelt a thousand miles away from him in spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said formally, choking down a lump in her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nBLACK IS SURPRISED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not in youth to be long cast down for the troubles of a stranger,\\r\\neven one who has very greatly engaged the sympathy. In spite of Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nanxiety about the wounded man, her resilient spirits had sent her\\r\\neagerly upon this adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would see Justin. He would approve her plans with enthusiasm.\\r\\nTogether they would ski across the white wastes, they two alone in\\r\\na vast world of mysterious stillness. The thin clear air of the\\r\\nhigh Rockies would carry their resonant voices like the chimes of\\r\\nbells. Silences would be significant, laughter the symbol of happy\\r\\ncomradeship. For the first time they would come glowing through\\r\\ndifficulties, perhaps dangers, conquered side by side. And at the end\\r\\nof the journey waited for them service, that which gave their joyous\\r\\nenterprise the value of an obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was not at all like that--not a bit as she had day-dreamed it\\r\\non the ride to Sweetwater Dam. The joy was struck dead in her heart.\\r\\nMiserably she realized that Justin could not understand. The ardent\\r\\nfire that burned in her soul seemed only mushy sentiment to him, on\\r\\na par with the hysteria that made silly women send flowers to brutal\\r\\nmurderers they did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bars were up between them. The hard look in his eyes meant anger.\\r\\nThere would be no expression of it in temper. He was too self-contained\\r\\nfor that. None the less it was anger. The reflection of it gleamed\\r\\nout from under her own dark lashes. She told herself she hated the\\r\\nnarrowness in him that made him hold so rigidly to the well-ordered,\\r\\nthe conventional thing. Why couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he see that there was an\\r\\nimperative on her to _live_? Well, she would show him. Probably he\\r\\nthought that in every clash of will she ought to yield. He could learn\\r\\nhis lesson just as well now as later.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held her head high, but there was a leaden weight in her bosom that\\r\\nmade her want to sob.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften she had been proud of his tremendous driving power, the force\\r\\nthat made of him a sixty-horse-power man. She resented it fiercely\\r\\nto-day. He was traveling just a little too fast for her, so that she\\r\\ncould hardly keep up with him. But she would have fallen in her tracks\\r\\nrather than ask him to go slower.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the slither of his runners stopped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I going too fast?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nasked coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered stubbornly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struck out again. They were climbing a long slope that ended in a\\r\\nfringe of timber. At the top he waited, watching her as she labored up\\r\\nheavily. The look he gave her when she reached him said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you\\r\\nso.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore them lay a valley, beyond which was another crest of pines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow far now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty asked, panting from the climb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust beyond that ridge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said indifferently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThought it was a long way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll coast into the valley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe watched him gliding into the dip of the slope. He was not an expert\\r\\non runners as her father was, but he had learned the trick of the thing\\r\\npretty well. It was in line with his thoroughness not to be a novice\\r\\nlong at anything he set out to master.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty shot down after him, gathering impetus as she went. She was\\r\\nwatching the path ahead, and it was not till she was close upon him\\r\\nthat she saw Merrick had fallen. She swerved to the left, flinging out\\r\\nher arms to prevent herself from going down. Unsteadily she teetered\\r\\nfor a moment, but righted herself with an effort and kept going till\\r\\nshe reached the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick was on his feet when she turned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything wrong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she called.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of my skis broken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went back to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did it happen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDipped into a rock under the snow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His voice was sullen. Like many\\r\\nmen who do well whatever they undertake, he resented any mishap due\\r\\nto lack of his own skill. His sense of superiority would have been\\r\\nsatisfied if the accident had befallen her instead of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty did not smile, but, nevertheless, she was maliciously pleased. It\\r\\nwould bring him down a peg, anyhow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll you do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose I can hobble along somehow. Perhaps I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better take your\\r\\nskis and hurry on. I could borrow a pair at the cabin and come back for\\r\\nyou. Yes, I think that would be better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go on and send Mr. Black with a pair.\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather not wait here in the cold. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not be long. You can keep\\r\\nmoving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not suit Merrick at all. He did not want to be regarded as an\\r\\nincompetent who had bogged down in the snow. It hurt his pride that\\r\\nBetty should go on and send back help to him, especially when they felt\\r\\ncriss-cross toward each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who is at the cabin.\\r\\nThat tramp Cig may be there--or Prowers. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dangerous, both of\\r\\nthem. Yesterday they tried to blow up the men working on the tunnel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can lend me your revolver, then, if you like. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not afraid.\\r\\nMr. Black wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them hurt me even if they wanted to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not very cold. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be back in a little while. And, as you say,\\r\\nyou could keep moving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered, and her quiet voice told him she had\\r\\nmade up her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unbuckled his belt and handed it to her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be safer with that\\r\\n.38,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. What he thought is not of record.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThanks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little smile, with its hint of sarcasm, suggested\\r\\nthat there was not the least need of the revolver; if she wore it,\\r\\nthe only reason was to humor his vanity and let him feel that he was\\r\\nprotecting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe crossed the valley and climbed the ridge. From the farther side of\\r\\nit she looked down upon a log cabin of two rooms, a small stable, and a\\r\\ncorral. They nestled in a draw at her feet, so close that a man could\\r\\nhave thrown a stone almost to the fence. The hillside was rough with\\r\\nstones. With Justin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mishap in mind, she felt her way down carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoke poured out of the chimney and polluted the pure light air. No\\r\\nneed of seeing the fire inside to know that the wood was resinous fir.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty knocked on the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt opened. Black stood on the threshold looking down at her in\\r\\nludicrous amazement. She had taken off her coat and was carrying it.\\r\\nAgainst a background of white she bloomed vivid as a poinsettia in her\\r\\nold-rose sweater and jaunty tam. The cold crisp air had whipped the\\r\\nscarlet into her lips, the pink into her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat in--Mexico!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mr. Hollister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA mighty sick man. Howcome you here, miss?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of a querulous voice came from within. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell you I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want\\r\\nthe stuff. How many times I got to say it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to nurse him. Billy brought us word. Father wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t home--nor\\r\\nLon. So Mr. Merrick brought me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerrick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over the hill, a ways back. Broke a ski. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like you to take\\r\\nhim a pair. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look after Mr. Hollister.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she followed the lank range rider into the cabin, she pulled off her\\r\\ngauntlets. Her cold fingers fumbled with the ski ties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLemme do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black said, and dropped on a knee to help.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guess you can do it quicker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She looked at the patient and let her\\r\\nvoice fall as she asked a question. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs he delirious?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrazy as a hydryphoby skunk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He repeated what he had said before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\nmighty sick man, looks like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty looked into the hot, fevered face of the man tossing on the bed.\\r\\nFrom her medicine kit she took a thermometer. His fever was high. She\\r\\nprepared medicine and coaxed him to swallow it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is he wounded?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the side.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you wash out the wound and bind it up?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x99m. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve took care of fellows shot up before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBleed much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight smart. Did you hear when Doc Rayburn was comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She found cold water and bathed the burning face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWisht he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hustle along,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the range rider said uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d With a flare of anger she turned on Black. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\r\\nshot him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dunno. He was shot through the window whilst he was ondressin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for\\r\\nbed. We come together from the old Thorwaldson cabin a while before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid that Cig do it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight have, at that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black was putting on his webs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReckon I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ndrift back an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pick up yore friend Merrick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said absently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was that tramp Cig or Jake Prowers, one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYore guess is as good as mine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, buttoning to the neck a\\r\\nleather coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we have more light in here? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dark. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d draw back that\\r\\nwindow curtain--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen Mr. Bushwhacker would get a chanct for another shot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\ndryly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I reckon we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll leave the curtain where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer big startled eyes held fascinated to his. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nshoot him again now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMebbeso. My notion is better not give \\xe2\\x80\\x99em a show to get at him. You\\r\\nkeep the door closed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not be long. I see you got a gun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something significant in the way he said it. Her heart began\\r\\nto beat fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think--?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. If I did, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d stay right here. Not a chanct in a hundred.\\r\\nHow far back\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yore friend?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLess than a mile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely been movin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 right along. When I reach the ridge,\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give him the high sign an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 leave the skis stickin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up in the snow\\r\\nthere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And, as he was leaving, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be long,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she begged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you be scared, miss. Them sidewinders don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come out in the open\\r\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 do their wolf-killin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be gone but a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while. If\\r\\nanything worries you, bang away with that .38 an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come a-runnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe closed the door after him. From behind the curtain she watched him\\r\\nbegin the ascent. Then she went back to her patient and bathed his hot\\r\\nhands. Betty echoed the wish of the range rider that the doctor would\\r\\ncome. What could be keeping him? From the Diamond Bar K ranch to Wild\\r\\nHorse was only a few miles. He must have started before she did. It\\r\\nwould not be long now.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of a two days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 growth of beard, the young fellow on the bed\\r\\nlooked very boyish. She gently brushed back the curls matted on the\\r\\ndamp forehead. He was rambling again in desultory speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA cup o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cold water--cold lemonade. Happy days, she says. No trouble\\r\\nfriendship won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lighten, she says, with that game smile lighting up\\r\\nher face. Little thoroughbred.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA warm wave of exultant emotion beat through her blood. It reached her\\r\\nface in a glow of delicate beauty that transformed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou dear boy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried softly, and her eyes were shining stars of\\r\\ntender light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAN WITH THE BLEACHED BLUE EYES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not much she could do for him except bathe again his face\\r\\nand hands. He asked for a drink, and Betty propped him up with her\\r\\narm while she held the tin cup to his lips. Exhausted by the effort,\\r\\nhe sank back to the pillow and panted. All the supple strength of his\\r\\nsplendid youth had been drained from him. The muscles were lax, the\\r\\nmovements of the body feeble.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunken eyes stared at her without recognition. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take your\\r\\nhand, and say \\xe2\\x80\\x98Thank you\\xe2\\x80\\x99 too. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the _best_ little scout, the best\\r\\never.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the offered hand and pressed it gently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but now you must\\r\\nrest. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been sick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Boche got me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His wandering subconscious thoughts flowed into other\\r\\nmemories. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cZero hour, boys. Over the top and give \\xe2\\x80\\x99em hell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then,\\r\\nwithout any apparent break from one theme to another, his thick voice\\r\\nfell to a cunning whisper. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a joint on South Clark Street where\\r\\nI can get it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInto his disjointed mutterings her name came at times, spoken\\r\\nalways with a respect that was almost reverence. And perhaps a\\r\\nmoment later his voice would ring out clear and crisp in directions\\r\\nto the men working under him. Subjects merged into each other\\r\\ninconsequently--long-forgotten episodes of school days, college larks,\\r\\nmurmured endearments to the mother who had died many years since.\\r\\nListening to him, Betty knew that she was hearing revelations of a soul\\r\\nmasculine but essentially clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sound startled her, the click of the latch. She turned her head\\r\\nswiftly as the door opened. Fear drenched her heart. The man on the\\r\\nthreshold was Prowers. He had come out of a strong white light and at\\r\\nfirst could see nothing in the dark cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty watched him as he stood there, his bleached blue eyes blinking\\r\\nwhile they adjusted themselves to another focus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked sharply, the accent of alarm in her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA woman, by jiminy by jinks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The surprise in his squeaky voice was\\r\\npronounced. He moved forward to the bed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClint Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s girl. Where you\\r\\ncome from? How\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you get here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had drawn back to the wall at the head of the bed in order to keep\\r\\na space between them. Her heart was racing furiously. His cold eyes,\\r\\nwith the knife-edge stab in them, held hers fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI came in over the snow to nurse him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. Mr. Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the top of the hill. He broke a ski.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGone to meet him. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be here in a minute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA cunning, impish grin broke the lines of the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leathery face.\\r\\nHe remembered that he had come prepared to be surprised to hear of\\r\\nHollister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wound. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNurse who?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked suavely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Hollister, the engineer driving the tunnel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSick, is he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He scarcely took the trouble to veil his rancorous\\r\\nmalice. It rode him, voice, manner, and mocking eye. His mouth was a\\r\\nthin straight line, horribly cruel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome one shot him--last night--through the window.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She knew now that\\r\\nhe had done it or had had it done. The sense of outrage, of horror at\\r\\nhis unhuman callousness, drove the fear out of her bosom. Her eyes\\r\\naccused him, though her tongue made no charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShot him, by jiminy by jinks! Why, Daniels had ought to put the fellow\\r\\nin the calaboose. Who did it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she flashed back.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis evil grin derided her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow would I know, my dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew up a chair and sat down. The girl did not move. Rigid and\\r\\nwatchful, she did not let her eye waver from him for an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded toward the delirious man. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill he make it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoc seen him yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlad I came. I can help nurse him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He cut short a high cackle of\\r\\nlaughter to ask a question. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yore gun for, dearie? You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthrow it on poor Jake Prowers, would you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was as deadly as dynamite, she thought, more treacherous than a\\r\\nrattlesnake. She wanted to cry out her horror at him. To see him\\r\\nsitting there, humped up like a spider, not three feet from the man he\\r\\nhad tried to murder, filled her with repulsion. There was more in her\\r\\nfeeling than that; a growing paralysis of terror lest he might reach\\r\\nout and in a flash complete the homicide he had attempted.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to reason this away. He dared not do it, with her here as a\\r\\nwitness, with two men drawing closer every minute. Don Black had told\\r\\nher that he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t strike in the open, and the range rider had known\\r\\nhim more years than she had lived. But the doubt remained. She did not\\r\\nknow what he would do. Since she did not live in the same world as he,\\r\\nit was not possible for her to follow his thought processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with no previous intimation that his delirium had dropped from\\r\\nhim, the wounded man startled Betty by asking a rational question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you come to see how good a job you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quietly to\\r\\nProwers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowman shook his head, still with the Satanic grin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo job of\\r\\nmine, son. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thorough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour orders, but maybe not your hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister insisted feebly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty moved into his line of vision, and to his startled brain the\\r\\nmotion of her was like sweet unearthly music. He looked silently at her\\r\\nfor a long moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I still out of my head?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really you, is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, very gently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mustn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabin, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShot through the window, Black told me. Remember, if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get well,\\r\\nit was this man or Cig that did it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she promised. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get well. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ntalk, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust one thing. What are you doing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI came to look after you. Now that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all--please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said no more, in words. But the eyes of sick men are like those of\\r\\nchildren. They tell the truth. From them is stripped the veil woven by\\r\\ntime and the complexities of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSounds of voices on the hillside drifted to the cabin. Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart\\r\\nleaped joyfully. Friends were at hand. It was too late now for Prowers\\r\\nto do any harm even if it was in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voices approached the cabin. The girl recognized that of Merrick,\\r\\nstrong and dominant and just a little heavy. She heard Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drawling\\r\\nanswer, without being able to distinguish the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened. Four men came into the room. The two who brought up\\r\\nthe rear were Dr. Rayburn and Lon Forbes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Lon!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty cried, and went to him with a rush. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m awf\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly glad\\r\\nyou came.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clung to him, trembling, a sob in her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rawboned foreman patted her shoulder with a touch of embarrassment.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere--there, honey, \\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you wait for old Lon\\r\\ninstead o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hoppin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 away like you done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers tilted back his chair on two legs and chirped up with satiric\\r\\ncomment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got quite a nice party present. Any late arrivals not yet\\r\\nheard from?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Lon and Justin Merrick were taken aback. In the darkness they had\\r\\nnot yet recognized the little man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman spoke dryly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 known it. Trouble and Jake Prowers\\r\\nhunt in couples. Always did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could get a right good testimonial from Mr. Lon Forbes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the cowman\\r\\nsaid, with his high cackle of splenetic laughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood old Lon,\\r\\ndownright an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 four-square, always a booster for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty whispered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an awful man, Lon. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m scared of him. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow any minute what he was going to do. Oh, I _am_ glad you came.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSame here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lon replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you be scared, Betty. He can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do a\\r\\nthing--not a thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick had been taking off his skis. He came up to Betty now. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid he\\r\\nannoy you--say anything or--?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Justin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A shiver ran down her spine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe just looked and grinned.\\r\\nI wanted to scream. He shot Mr. Hollister. I know he did. Or had it\\r\\ndone by that Cig.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doubt that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor, disencumbered of impedimenta of snowshoes and wraps, fussed\\r\\nforward to the bedside. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see--let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe examined the wound, effervesced protests and questions, and prepared\\r\\nfor business with the bustling air that characterized him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOuta the room now--all but Miss Reed and one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you men. Lon, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ndo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d announced Merrick with decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right. All right. I want some clean rags, Black. You got plenty of\\r\\nhot water, I see. Clear out, boys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a good nurse, Doc?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers asked, not without satiric\\r\\nmalice. He was playing with fire, and he knew it. Everybody in the room\\r\\nsuspected him of this crime. He felt a perverted enjoyment in their\\r\\nhostility.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack chose this moment to make his declaration of independence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nlight a shuck outa here if I was you, Jake, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come back,\\r\\nseems to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold, bleached eyes of the cowman narrowed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re givin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me that\\r\\nadvice _as a friend_, are you, Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range rider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jaw stopped moving. In his cheek the tobacco quid\\r\\nstuck out. His face, habitually set to the leathery imperturbability of\\r\\nhis calling, froze now to an expressionless mask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure givin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you that advice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said evenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear so awful good, Don. As a friend, did you say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nlittle man cupped an ear with one hand in ironic mockery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gaze was hard as gun-metal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hit the trail for home\\r\\nif I was you, Jake, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d stay there for a spell with kinda low\\r\\nvisibility like they said in the war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI getcha, Don.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers shot a blast of cold lightning from under his\\r\\nscant brows. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can take a hint without waitin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for a church to fall\\r\\non me. Rats an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a sinkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ship, eh? You got a notion these fellows are\\r\\nliable to win out on me, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you want to quit while the quittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is\\r\\ngood. I been wonderin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for quite a while if you wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yellow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that wonderin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out loud, Jake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the other warned quietly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nyou do, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sure enough find out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man laughed scornfully, met in turn defiantly the eyes of\\r\\nBetty, Merrick, and Forbes, turned on his heel, and sauntered out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nBETTY HAS HER OWN WAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDon Black had not himself built the cabin where he lived. While he was\\r\\nstill a boy jingling his first spurs, two young Englishmen had hewn its\\r\\nlogs out of the untouched forest on the western slope of Pegleg Pass.\\r\\nThey were remittance men, exiled from their country for the peace of\\r\\nmind of their families. In the casual fashion of their class they had\\r\\ndrifted to the Rockies to hunt for big game and, less industriously,\\r\\nfor elusive fortune. Long since they had returned to the estates which\\r\\nBritishers of this type seem always to be inheriting from convenient\\r\\nrelatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the simple process of moving in, Black had become owner of the\\r\\ncabin. He hung his pinched-in cowboy hat on a peg in the wall and\\r\\nthereby took possession. His title was perfectly good in the eyes of\\r\\nthe range riders who dropped in occasionally and made themselves at\\r\\nhome. Whether Don was or was not on the place, they were welcome to\\r\\nwhat they found. The only obligation on them was to cut a fresh supply\\r\\nof firewood in place of that they used.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne room was enough for Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs. The other served as a place\\r\\nin which to store old saddles, mountain-lion pelts, worn-out boots,\\r\\nblankets, unused furniture, and a hundred odds and ends. With the help\\r\\nof the owner, Lon Forbes set to work housecleaning. Useless litter went\\r\\nflying out of doors. A vigorous broom in the hands of Lon raised clouds\\r\\nof dust. In the fireplace old papers and boxes blazed cheerfully. A\\r\\nNavajo rug, resurrected from the bottom of a hingeless trunk, covered\\r\\nthe floor in front of a walnut bed imported by one of the Englishmen\\r\\nfrom Denver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took hours to make the transformation, but the foreman was quite\\r\\npleased with himself when he ushered Betty into the bedroom he had\\r\\nprepared for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clapped her hands softly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy, Lon! What a fine wife some\\r\\nSuffragette\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost in you. Maybe it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too late yet. You can keep\\r\\nhouse while she--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelp! Help!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expostulated Forbes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got your eye on one of these little flapper girls, of\\r\\ncourse, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use my saying a word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she teased. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know how\\r\\nstubborn you are when you get \\xe2\\x80\\x98sot.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in a mood of happy reaction from the fears that had oppressed\\r\\nher all day. Dr. Rayburn had told her--with some reservations, to be\\r\\nsure--that, barring unexpected complications, Hollister ought to get\\r\\nwell. It would take time and nursing and good food, but all of these\\r\\nthe patient would get.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got my eye on one of them li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 flapper girls--this\\r\\nvery minute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he rapped back promptly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sure-enough warnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nto a fellow to play his hand out alone unless he wants to be bossed\\r\\nsomethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 scandalous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would do you good to be bossed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told him, eyes dancing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nrefining influence of a young woman--say about forty-five or maybe\\r\\nfifty--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pickin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 her for me, are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snorted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do the picking when the time comes. I suppose you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to\\r\\ngive up smoking--and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to shave every day--and probably be a\\r\\ndeacon in the church at Wild Horse--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I will not. All I got to do is look at Clint an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 see how a\\r\\nhalf-grown kid has got a check rein on him. That scares me a plenty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHe shook his head in mock despair, but his eyes gave him away.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGallivantin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 into the hills, through \\xe2\\x80\\x99steen million tons of snow, to\\r\\nnurse a scalawag who--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no scalawag, Lon Forbes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike to know why he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but a hobo when you first met up\\r\\nwith him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Lon, you know very well you told me you thought he was a man from\\r\\nthe ground up. Those were the very words you used.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, a hobo may be a man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he defended. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyways, that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ought to bust up yore happy home to hike over the hills for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been talking to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she charged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybeso, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 maybe not. That ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the point. While Clint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s away, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nup to me to run the Diamond Bar K.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith Justin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cut in.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty thought, though she did not express it in words, that Lon would\\r\\nhave his hands full if he intended to take charge of her activities as\\r\\na part of the ranch. She knew that this would never have occurred to\\r\\nhim as included in his duties if it had not been suggested by Merrick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not askin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 any one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help. I reckon I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m as grown-up as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever\\r\\nbe. Anyways, Clint put me in charge, figurin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I was man-size an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\ncompetent. Question is, Would yore father want you up here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty decided to carry the war indignantly into the territory of the\\r\\nenemy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, he would. After knowing Dad all these years I should\\r\\nthink you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be ashamed to doubt him. Dad pays his debts. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good\\r\\nfriend. This boy--this young fellow Hollister--tried to do us a good\\r\\nturn after we had behaved pretty bad to him. You know Dad has been\\r\\nlooking for a chance to help him. Well, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s come. What are we going to\\r\\ndo about it? Go through--or quit on the job?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo through. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t proposin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 anything else. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to\\r\\nstay here. I can look after him, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see you home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you know about nursing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she scoffed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr cooking? You know\\r\\nwhat the doctor said. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to have nice things to eat after he gets\\r\\na little better. And good nursing. Dr. Rayburn told you--I heard him\\r\\nsay it--that he was glad I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come because Mr. Hollister needs a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnursing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLon scratched his head to help him think. It was sometimes a laborious\\r\\nprocess. He knew cattle and crops, but chaperoning a young woman was\\r\\nuntried territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTimes has changed, Betty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou kinda growed up\\r\\nhelter-skelter an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 run wild. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a young lady now, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbe too careful. You gotta think about what folks\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFiddlesticks! What\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll they say? What can they say if you stay up here\\r\\nwith me? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be only a day or two till Dad gets home. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just that\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been getting notions from Justin. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a city man and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow our ways. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always lived here, Lon. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m surprised at you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course there ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any real harm in yore stayin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he conceded\\r\\nhesitantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be here to look after you an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 see Prowers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ntrouble you. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m staying because I really can help, Lon. Justin thinks it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only\\r\\nfoolishness, but you know it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. In Denver, where he lives, there\\r\\nare plenty of trained nurses, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different here. If Bridget could\\r\\nget in, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say a word about staying. But she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. If I went\\r\\naway and left this poor boy, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never respect me again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would, too. But there. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna stay. I see that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She caught the lapels of the big foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coat and coaxed\\r\\nhim with the smile that always had proved effective with him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you\\r\\nknow I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m right. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, Lon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he blustered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to come it\\r\\nover me. I know you too blamed well, miss. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bound an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 determined\\r\\nto have yore own way--always were since you were a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 trick\\r\\nknee-high to a duck. Trouble is, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been spoiled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand you did it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo such a thing. I always did tell Clint he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d find out some day what\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\ncome of lettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you boss the whole works.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To save his face he finished\\r\\nwith a peremptory order. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fixin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up some supper. Soon as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nhad yours, why, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go right straight to bed. Doc an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me are aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nto look after Hollister to-night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Lon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty replied meekly. She had got what she wanted, and\\r\\nshe was willing to propitiate him by a demure obedience calculated to\\r\\nremove the sting of her victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon opened the door and announced that supper was ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty saw Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye flash a question at Forbes as they came into\\r\\nthe larger room. She went directly to him. Betty was a woman; therefore\\r\\ncomplex. But she usually expressed herself simply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all settled, Justin. Lon is going to stay with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer in words, but his salient jaw set grimly. Like many\\r\\nmasterful men, he did not relish defeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drank coffee from tin cups and ate bacon, tomatoes, and beans\\r\\nserved in tin plates. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biscuits were appetizing, and four or five\\r\\npans of them disappeared before his guests were fed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty lived up to the promise she had made Lon. She whispered with Dr.\\r\\nRayburn for a minute, then said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-night\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the company generally,\\r\\nand vanished into her bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day had been a full one. To come in over the snow had taxed the\\r\\nstrength of her muscles. She was tired, and, as she sat before the\\r\\nglowing coals taking the pins out of her hair, she yawned luxuriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust now her mind was on Merrick. The vague disappointment in their\\r\\nrelationship had crystallized to-day into definite dissatisfaction. To\\r\\nuse one of her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expressions, Justin and she had not come out of\\r\\nthe same pasture. They thought in different languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat he had not sympathized with the urge in her to spend herself\\r\\nin service for the wounded man was important beyond the immediate\\r\\nquestion. And, even if he did not agree with her, he should have\\r\\nunderstood her obligation to do as she thought best. It involved their\\r\\nwhole future. The trouble was that he did not recognize her right to\\r\\nfollow the guidance of her own judgment. She must defer to him, must\\r\\naccept his decision as final.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty knew she could not do that. In essence she was a\\r\\ntwentieth-century woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nA CHILD OF IMPULSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty went to sleep critical of Justin. She woke, in the dawn of a\\r\\nnew day streaming through the window, to censure of her own conduct.\\r\\nWillful though the girl was, she had a capacity for generosity that\\r\\nsaved her from selfishness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was just as Lon said, her thoughts ran. She had to boss everybody\\r\\nand everything, always had to have her own way without regard to\\r\\nothers. No wonder Justin did not like it. If she had tried hard enough,\\r\\nshe could have made him see that this adventure was a duty laid on her,\\r\\none she could not escape and retain her self-respect. Instead, she had\\r\\nmanaged so badly that she had thrown him quite out of sympathy with her\\r\\npoint of view.\\r\\n\\r\\nA child of impulse, she decided swiftly as she dressed to have a little\\r\\ntalk with him and say she was sorry. With this resolve came peace.\\r\\nEverything would be all right now between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister smiled when she came to his bedside and asked him how he was.\\r\\nHis face reassured her. It was very pale, but it held the look of one\\r\\nwho means to get well. Dr. Rayburn backed its promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing fine. Fever gone down a lot. Nursing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing now, Miss\\r\\nBetty. You can do more for him than I can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you going back to town to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGot to. No two ways about that. Be back day after to-morrow probably.\\r\\nKeep giving him the tablets. Every two hours. And a teaspoon of the\\r\\nliquid three times a day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had drawn away from the bedside and by mutual consent passed out\\r\\nof the door into the sunshine. The crisp morning air was delightful. A\\r\\nmillion glints of light sparkled from the snow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really better, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked eagerly, and her voice\\r\\nthrobbed with young life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter, yes. But--sometimes a man seems definitely to be on the\\r\\nmend and then he relapses without any apparent cause. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too soon\\r\\nto say he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting better. All I can say is that, if no unfavorable\\r\\ncomplications set in, he ought to improve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOught you to leave him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe threw up his hands in an energy of exasperation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you had half as\\r\\nmuch to do as I have, young lady--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know, but if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really still in danger--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDanger!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fumed the doctor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think Mrs. Pillsbury can wait for\\r\\nhim to get out of danger?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBabies are born when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re born,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he sputtered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to leave\\r\\nfor town right after breakfast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin came round the corner of the house. Betty almost ran to give him\\r\\nher hand. Her eyes were shining wells of friendliness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to see you after breakfast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded, non-committally.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack called from inside, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYore coffee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s b\\xe2\\x80\\x99ilin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, folks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave them flapjacks and syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI love flapjacks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir host said nothing, but he was pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nLon came in late and drew up a chair beside Betty. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s everything\\r\\nthis glad mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99ning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFine as the wheat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She added as an aside, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the bossy little\\r\\nflapper isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t half so bossy as she sometimes lets on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis grin met her smile. They understood each other very well and were\\r\\nstill friends. Betty pushed into the back of her mind a fugitive wish\\r\\nthat Justin could know and appreciate her as well as good old Lon did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast Betty and Merrick took a short walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cScrumptious day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she commented. Then, as though it were a\\r\\ncontinuation of the same thought: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry, Justin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean--?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m kinda horrid sometimes. I flare out and say \\xe2\\x80\\x98I will\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nlike a spoiled kid. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She smiled at him, a little\\r\\nwhimsically, a little apologetically. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt keeps me busy eating humble\\r\\npie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe accepted her apology graciously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall we forget it, Bess? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nnew day. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll turn a page of the ledger and begin again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRather timidly, she went on: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had to come. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that. But if I\\r\\nhadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been so tempery, I could have made you understand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stiffened at once. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I understood--perfectly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Justin. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just it. You didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, or you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have stood in\\r\\nmy way. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fair-minded, and when you see I was doing what I had to\\r\\ndo--what it was my duty to do--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree with you about that, Betty. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m older than you are. I\\r\\nthink I know more of the world. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not your duty--the duty of any\\r\\nunmarried girl for that matter, unless she is a trained professional\\r\\nnurse--to put herself in the position you have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her good resolutions Betty began to feel her temper slip.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat position have I put myself in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an old-fashioned man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe that a young woman\\r\\nmust be so circumspect that nobody can find any ground to talk about\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA girl isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a china doll. She can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be put away in moth balls,\\r\\nJustin. Every girl is talked about some time or other by somebody if\\r\\nshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alive. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of no importance what gossips say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of the greatest importance that a girl give no chance for idle\\r\\ngossip about her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irritation expressed itself in the voice, a trifle sharp. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow\\r\\ndo you think I can run the Quarter Circle D E without being criticized?\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m there with the men hours and days at a time, and no other woman on\\r\\nthe place except old Mandy, who is deaf as a post and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see six\\r\\nfeet from her nose. If any evil-minded person wants to talk--why, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\njust have to let him talk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, I think you ought to have a foreman run the place for\\r\\nyou except for some general supervision. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? You never told me so before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou never asked me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor that matter, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not asking you now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her manner was dangerously\\r\\nquiet. It suggested banked fires of anger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut just the same I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad\\r\\nto have your opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad to give it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted to tell you what I think about it.\\r\\nUnderstand me. I admire your energy, your enthusiasm, your efficiency.\\r\\nI believe you are running the Quarter Circle D E better than a good\\r\\nmany men could do it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the question. Aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you losing\\r\\nsomething you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to do without? I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into this in\\r\\ndetail. Cattle-raising--ranching--breeding Herefords--it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a splendid\\r\\noccupation for a man. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a side of it that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s--well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d turn it all over to Forbes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want me to do--stay at home and knit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know what I want as soon as the Sweetwater project is finished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty side-stepped the proposed excursion into sentiment. She was a\\r\\ndownright young woman and wanted to know exactly where she stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you felt that way about the ranch, Justin. I thought you\\r\\nshared my view, that I was doing something worth while when I raised\\r\\nhundreds of cattle every year to help feed the world. If I had known\\r\\nyou thought I was degrading myself--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She stopped, a tremolo of anger\\r\\nin her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that, Betty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you meant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. No, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I meant only that--well, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something very very\\r\\nprecious that some girls have--that you have, Betty--something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlike the bloom of a peach. If you lose it--well, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I do anything that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth while--if I pay my way in the world\\r\\nby giving value received--the peach bloom is rubbed off, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nretorted scornfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there different ways of giving service? We are in danger of\\r\\nforgetting the home, which is the normal place for a young girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it? Thought you came from a city where thousands of girls go down\\r\\nto offices and stores every morning to earn a living.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood on a small hilltop and looked over a world blanketed in\\r\\nwhite which flashed back countless gleams of light to the heliographing\\r\\nsun, a world so virgin clean, so still and empty of life, that it\\r\\ncarried Betty back to the birthday of the race. She was, miraculously,\\r\\nat the beginning of things again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not in a city fortunately,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no economic\\r\\npressure on you to fight sordidly for a living.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes sparkled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not consistent. When the city ways don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsuit you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m to live like people in the country, but when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\napprove of ranch ways, then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m to be like girls in Denver. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not to\\r\\ngo into business, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not to be neighborly as my mother was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re distorting what I said, Betty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I? Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you say I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to help take care of a sick man because\\r\\nit wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t proper?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said you were acting rather absurdly about this man Hollister,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nreplied tartly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no call to turn the world upside down because\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wounded. You want a sense of proportion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you need, Justin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered, a flush of anger\\r\\nburning her cheeks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been horrid about it from the start without\\r\\nany reason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved down the hill toward the cabin. Merrick walked beside her.\\r\\nHis eyes were hard and his lips set close.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time it dawned upon Betty that he was jealous of her\\r\\ninterest in another man. He was possessive, wanted to absorb all her\\r\\nthoughts, intended to be the center of every activity she had. This did\\r\\nnot please her. It alarmed the individual in her. Marriage, as she had\\r\\ndreamed it, was wonderful because it enhanced life. It was the union of\\r\\ntwo souls, releasing all the better forces of their natures. Through\\r\\nit would come freedom and not bondage. The joys of the senses would be\\r\\nshared and transmuted to spiritual power. They ought not to put chains\\r\\non a man or a woman that would narrow the horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn illusion had been shattered. Justin was not the man with whom she\\r\\ncould walk hand in hand. She sighed, and drew the gauntlet from her\\r\\nleft hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick looked at the ring she had dropped into his hand, then straight\\r\\nat her with rigid gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you in love with this fellow Hollister? Is that what it means?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nasked harshly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe color in her cheeks deepened. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s--hateful of you, Justin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid, her voice ragged with feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it for some time. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re infatuated with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lifted her chin and looked at him with eyes that blazed anger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow\\r\\nI know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done right in giving you back your ring. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going\\r\\nto--to quarrel with you because you insult me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finished. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA sob rose to her throat and choked her. She hurried on to escape him,\\r\\nthe trail a blurred mist through her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\nFATHOMS DEEP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe days followed each other, clear, sparkling, crisp, with mornings\\r\\nin which Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lungs drew in a winey exhilaration of living, with\\r\\nevenings which shut the cabin on the slope of Pegleg Pass from a remote\\r\\nworld of men and women engaged in a thousand activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty had time to think during the long winter nights after she had\\r\\nretired to her room. Some of her thoughts hurt. She was shocked at\\r\\nthe termination of her engagement, at the manner of it. That was not\\r\\nthe way it should have been done at all. She and Justin should have\\r\\nrecognized frankly that their views of life could not be made to\\r\\nharmonize. They should have parted with esteem and friendship. Instead\\r\\nof which there had been a scene of which she was ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cheeks burned when she recalled his crass charge that she was\\r\\ninfatuated with Hollister. Why hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he been able to understand that\\r\\nshe had signed a pact of friendship with the ex-service man? If he had\\r\\ndone that, if he had been wise and generous and sympathetic instead of\\r\\nharsh and grudging, he would (so Betty persuaded herself) have won her\\r\\nheart completely. He had been given a great chance, and he had not been\\r\\nworthy of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick had humiliated her, shattered for the time at least the gallant\\r\\nyoung egoism which made her the mistress of her world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father came up as soon as he returned from Denver. She talked\\r\\nover with him the break with her fianc\\xc3\\xa9. Clint supported her, with\\r\\nreservations that did not reach the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever did like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said bluntly, referring to her engagement.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good man in his way, but not the one for you. I been\\r\\nfiguring you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad this came up. His ideas about marriage\\r\\nare crusted. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d put a wife in a cage and treat her well. That\\r\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suit you, Bess. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to have room to try your wings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clung to him, crying a little. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame me, then, Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a bit. You did right. If Merrick had been the proper man for you,\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have understood you well enough to know you had to come here.\\r\\nMaybe it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wise to come. Maybe it was impulsive. I reckon most\\r\\nfolks would agree with him about that. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have known his Betty.\\r\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 helped you, even though it was foolish. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be happy\\r\\nwith any man who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let you fly the coop once in a while.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it foolish to come, Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stroked her dark hair gently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the foolishness we all love in\\r\\nyou, honey--that way you have of giving till it hurts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty had inherited her impulsiveness from him. He, too, could be\\r\\ngenerous without counting the cost. He rejoiced in the eagerness with\\r\\nwhich her spirit went out to offer the gift of herself. But he had to\\r\\nbe both father and mother. Generosity might easily carry her too far.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do such crazy things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I never know they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re silly\\r\\ntill afterward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t silly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reassured her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have figured out some other\\r\\nway if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been home. But I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Rayburn says your cooking an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 your\\r\\nnursing have helped young Hollister a lot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad you came, now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nover with. I reckon you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve paid my debt in full, Bettykins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absurdly grateful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done much for him. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nthink I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d saved his life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoon now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to get him back to the ranch and Bridget can\\r\\ntake care of him. Ruth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wearyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be more satisfied when\\r\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got old Jake Prowers on my mind some. Never can tell\\r\\nwhat he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be up to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister was grateful to Betty, whether absurdly so or not is a matter\\r\\nof definitions. His big eyes followed her about the room as she cooked\\r\\ncustards with the eggs and milk brought from the Howard place just\\r\\nbelow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSweet Marie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d did not entrance him when Black tunelessly sang\\r\\nit, but the snatches of song she hummed at her work filled the room\\r\\nwith melody for him. She read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavid Copperfield\\xe2\\x80\\x9d aloud after he began\\r\\nto mend, and his gaze rested on her with the mute admiration sick men\\r\\nare likely to give charming nurses overflowing with good-will and\\r\\nvitality. Her laugh lifted like a lark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s song. Even her smile had the\\r\\nradiant quality of one who is hearing good news.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe noticed that she was no longer wearing Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ring, and his\\r\\nthoughts dwelt on it a good deal. Was the engagement broken? He could\\r\\nnot see that she was unhappy. Her presence filled the place with\\r\\nsunshine. It was a joy to lie there and know that she was near, even\\r\\nwhen she was in another room and he could not see her. There was\\r\\nsomething permeating about Betty Reed. She lit up men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s souls as an\\r\\narc-light does a dark street.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hoped that she and Merrick had come to the parting of the ways. The\\r\\nengineer was the last man in the world to make her eager spirit happy.\\r\\nHis strength never spent itself in rebellion. He followed convention\\r\\nand would look for the acceptance of it in her. But Betty was cast in\\r\\nanother mould. What was important to him did not touch her at all, or,\\r\\nif it did, seemed a worthless sham. She laughed at social usage when it\\r\\nbecame mere formalism. No doubt she would be a disturbing wife. Life\\r\\nwith her would be exciting. That was not what Justin Merrick wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right man for her would be one who both loved and understood. He\\r\\nmust be big enough to let her enthusiasms sweep over their lives and\\r\\nmust even give them moral support while they lasted. Also, he must be a\\r\\nclean and stalwart outdoor man, not one who had been salvaged from the\\r\\nyellow swamp waters of vice. This last Hollister kept before him as a\\r\\nfundamental necessity. He laid hold of it to stamp down the passionate\\r\\ninsurgent longings that filled him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an obligation on him. He must not abuse her kindness by\\r\\nforgetting that he had been an outcast, had himself shut a door upon\\r\\nany future that included the fine purity of her youth. An effect of\\r\\nher simplicity was that he stood in constant danger of not remembering\\r\\nthis. There was nothing of the Lady Bountiful about Betty. Her\\r\\nstar-clear eyes, the song and sunlight of her being, offered friendship\\r\\nand _camaraderie_ with no assumption of superior virtue. She saw\\r\\nno barrier between them. They came together on an equal footing as\\r\\ncomrades. The girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unconscious generosity enhanced her charm and made\\r\\nthe struggle in his heart more difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose days while he lay there and gathered strength were red-letter\\r\\nones in his life. Given the conditions, it was inevitable that he\\r\\nshould come to care for the gracious spirit dwelling in a form that\\r\\nexpressed so lovingly the mystery of maiden dreams. In every fiber of\\r\\nhim he cherished her loveliness and pulsed to the enticement of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave the dull cabin atmosphere. A light burned inside her that\\r\\nwas warm and bright and colorful. Black looked on her as he might a\\r\\ncreature from another world. This slip of a girl had brought something\\r\\nnew into the range rider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, something fine and spiritual which\\r\\nevoked response from his long-dormant soul. He had till now missed the\\r\\njoy of being teased by a girl as innocent and as vivid as she.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister was won the easier because her tenderness was for him.\\r\\nBlack must hunt ptarmigan for broth, Clint Reed go foraging for milk\\r\\nand eggs. They submitted cheerfully to be bullied in the interest of\\r\\nthe patient. His needs ruled the household, since he was an invalid.\\r\\nBetty pampered and petted and poked fun at him, all with a zeal that\\r\\ncaptivated his imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evenings they talked, three of them in a semi-circle before the\\r\\nblazing logs, the fourth sitting up in the bed propped by pillows. The\\r\\ntalk ranged far, from cattle to Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau-Thierry. It brought to the sick\\r\\nman a new sense of the values of life. These people lived far from the\\r\\nswift currents of urban rush and haste, but he found in them something\\r\\nthe world has lost, the serenity and poise that come from the former\\r\\nstandards of judgment. The feverish glitter of post-war excitement,\\r\\nits unrest and dissatisfaction, had left them untouched. Betty and her\\r\\nfather were somehow anchored to realities. They did not crave wealth.\\r\\nThey had within themselves sources of entertainment. The simple things\\r\\nof life gave them pleasure. He realized that there must be millions of\\r\\nsuch people in the country, and that through them it would eventually\\r\\nbe saved from the effects of its restlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\nBETTY MAKES A DISCOVERY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said, and did a little skip-step across the floor to\\r\\nput away the frying-pan she had been washing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have dancing feet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister told her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I have a dancing heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the man sitting before the fire she bloomed in that dark cabin like\\r\\na poppy in the desert. She was a hundred miracles each hour to him.\\r\\nHe saw the exquisite mystery of her personality express itself in all\\r\\nshe was and did--in the faint crimson just now streaming through her\\r\\ncheeks beneath the warm and tawny skin, in the charmingly shy gesture\\r\\nwith which she had accepted his compliment, in the low, vibrant voice\\r\\nthat played so wonderfully on his heartstrings. Not often is a sweet\\r\\nand singing soul clothed so exquisitely in a body of grace so young and\\r\\nlissom and vital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whenever there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an excuse for it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, smiling at\\r\\nher. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why feature to-morrow? Is it your birthday?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going home to-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you? I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fell silent, looking into the fire. It was not an unexpected\\r\\nannouncement. These good days could not go on forever. She had done\\r\\nmore for him than any other friend he had ever had. But, of course,\\r\\nlife made its claims on her. She had to respond to them. It was a\\r\\nwholly undeserved happiness that she had stayed till he was out of\\r\\ndanger and on the road to health. He wanted to tell her how he felt\\r\\nabout it, but he would never be able to do that. Inside, he seemed to\\r\\nmelt to a river of tears whenever he let himself dwell on her amazing\\r\\ngoodness to one who had been dead when first she gave him her little\\r\\nhand and now was alive again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUmpha, to-morrow. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m crazy to see Ruthie, and what the boys are doing\\r\\non the ranch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been an awful nuisance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The little laugh that welled out of her was sweet and\\r\\nmocking. It enveloped him with her gracious and tender young womanhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe liked to think that her nursing had pulled him through just as\\r\\nearlier her faith had rekindled in him self-respect and courage. The\\r\\nfacts might not quite justify this, but he did not intend to let brutal\\r\\nactualities murder a beautiful dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you can always point with pride, as the politicians say. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a\\r\\ncredit to your nursing. Off your hands in ten days.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not off my hands yet. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to the Diamond Bar K with\\r\\nus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood drummed faster through his heart. He felt a stinging of\\r\\nthe senses. Was there no end to the goodness of this astonishing and\\r\\ndisturbing girl? Must she always be flinging out life lines to him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood of you--awf\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly good of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He looked at the fire, not at her.\\r\\nHis voice was suspiciously low. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI might have known, knowing you. But I\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impose myself any longer. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be all right now at the camp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think Dad and I will quit in the middle of a good job? No,\\r\\nsir. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get credit for finishing it. Lon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breaking the\\r\\nroad with a sled to-day. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re to go down in it. Dr. Rayburn says he\\r\\nhasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t time to go up to the camp to look after your bandages. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nhave to put up with us for a while.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could go to the hotel at Wild Horse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never eaten a meal there. I see that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall settled. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming to the ranch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course you know I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ... I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ... thank you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His voice\\r\\nshook. This annoyed him. He told himself savagely not to act like a\\r\\nbaby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, everybody works at the Diamond Bar K,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said lightly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRuthie\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to school through the deep snow. You claim to be a college\\r\\nman. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out whether you can teach the First Reader and two\\r\\ntimes two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to answer in the same spirit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to call every\\r\\nbluff I make, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be more careful. Anyhow, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t study the First\\r\\nReader at college. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they teach it at Massachusetts Tech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the day he spoke to Reed on the subject. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to make\\r\\na nuisance of myself. I can put up at the Wild Horse House till I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nstrong enough to go back to camp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed had come out of the old-time cattle days when there were always a\\r\\nplate and a bed at the ranch for whoever might want them. He still kept\\r\\nopen house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlways room for one more, boy. Anyhow, if Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got it fixed up\\r\\nthat way in her mind, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d as well make up yours to do as she says.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be her say-so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The owner of the Diamond Bar K grinned at him\\r\\nconfidentially, as one fellow victim of feminine tyranny to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes arrived late in the afternoon and reported heavy roads. He had\\r\\nbrought a four-horse team, and it had been all they could do to break\\r\\nthrough. They had dragged a sled with the body of a wagon on the wide\\r\\nrunners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeep drifts below the rim in the cut the other side o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Round Top. Be\\r\\nall right if the wind don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blow to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind blew, and was still whistling when it came time to start. But\\r\\nthe sun was shining and the sky clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty was doubtful, on account of the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we wrop him up good, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lon said. The big foreman\\r\\ndid not want to stay in the hills until the trail he had broken was\\r\\nfilled up again with drifts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed Reed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug and Betty were tucked in with warm blankets. Forbes took the reins\\r\\nand drove out of the draw, past the Howard place, and up the steep hill\\r\\nbeyond. Betty had seen to it that her patient was wrapped to the nose\\r\\nin an old fur coat of her father. The whipping wind did not distress\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the summit they could see the great white wastes, stretching mile\\r\\non mile. The snow was soft and heavy, and the wind had not drifted\\r\\nit a great deal since Lon had driven through the previous day. But\\r\\nthe horses were pulling a load, and soon the sweat stood out on their\\r\\nbodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached and circled Round Top, passed a treacherous dugway, and\\r\\nmoved into the deep drifts below the rim. Betty looked up once and a\\r\\nlittle shudder ran down her spine. The wind up on the bluff had a clean\\r\\nsweep. Over the edge yawned a great snow comb that might at any moment\\r\\nloosen and come down to bury them in an immense white mausoleum. It\\r\\nmight, on the other hand, hang from the rim for months.\\r\\n\\r\\nLon cracked his whip close to the ear of the off leader. It might\\r\\nalmost have been a signal. From far above came the sound of an\\r\\nanswering crack. Reed looked up quickly. The snow comb slid forward,\\r\\nbroke, and came tearing down. It gathered momentum in its plunge,\\r\\nroaring down like an express train.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowman flung Betty into the bed of the sled and crouched over her\\r\\nas a protection against the white cloud of death rushing at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe avalanche swept into the ravine with thunderous noise, a hundred\\r\\ntons of packed snow. The bulk of its weight struck in front of the\\r\\nhorses, but the tail of the slide whipped a giant billow upon them and\\r\\nburied team and sled.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty fought and scrambled her way out of the snow. From it her\\r\\nfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head was emerging a few yards away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHurt?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. You?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJarred up. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all. Seen anything of Lon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head and broad shoulders of the foreman pushed up. Lon shook snow\\r\\nout of his hair, eyes, and ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others exchanged bulletins with him. He was, he said, as rampageous\\r\\nas a long-legged hill two-year-old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Hollister!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty quavered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer was nowhere to be seen. They called, and no answer came.\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart dropped like a plummet. She turned upon her father\\r\\nanguished eyes. They begged him to do something. He noticed that her\\r\\ncheeks were blanched, the color had ebbed from her lips. His daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndistress touched him nearly. He could not stand that stricken look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he promised.\\r\\n\\r\\nJammed between two trees, upside down, with one end sticking out of the\\r\\nsnow, they found the wagon bed at the bottom of the ravine. Forbes\\r\\nspoke to Reed in a low voice, for his ears alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a chance in fifty of findin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 him in all this snow, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if we do,\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not be alive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed the ranchman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a fellow knew where to look. But no\\r\\ntelling where the snow carried him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight still be under the wagon bed, o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMight be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA low groan reached them. They listened. It came again, from under the\\r\\nbed of the wagon apparently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clint called to Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drooping little figure crouched in the snow straightened as though\\r\\nan electric current had been shot through it. The girl waded toward\\r\\nthem, eager, animate with vigor, pulsing with hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Dad. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hurry. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get him out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed rapped the wagon bed with his knuckles. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow about it, Hollister?\\r\\nHurt much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnocked out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a weak voice answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuess I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m all right now. Arm\\r\\nscraped a bit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe handle of a shovel stuck out of the snow like a post. Lon worked it\\r\\nloose, tore the lower part free, and brought it to the bed. He began to\\r\\ndig. Reed joined him, using his leather gauntlets as spades. It took\\r\\nnearly half an hour to get Hollister out. He came up smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCold berth down there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said by way of comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not really hurt, are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing to speak of. The edge of the sled scraped the skin from my\\r\\narm. Feels a bit fiery. How about the horses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLon and his employer were already at work on them. Three of the\\r\\nanimals had pawed and kicked till they were back on their feet. The men\\r\\nhelped them back to the road, after unhitching them from the sled. It\\r\\nwas necessary to dig the fourth horse out of a deep drift into which it\\r\\nhad been flung.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty sat beside Hollister in the wagon bed on a pile of salvaged\\r\\nblankets. She felt strangely weak and shaken. It was as though the\\r\\nstrength had been drained out of her by the emotional stress through\\r\\nwhich she had passed. To be flung starkly against the chance, the\\r\\nprobability, that Tug was dead had been a terrible experience. The\\r\\nshock had struck her instantly, vitally, with paralyzing force. She\\r\\nleaned against the side of the bed laxly, trying to escape from the\\r\\nharrowing intensity of her feeling. That she could suffer so acutely,\\r\\nso profoundly, was a revelation to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the meaning of it? Why had the strength and energy ebbed from\\r\\nher body as they do from one desperately wounded? It was disturbing and\\r\\nperplexing. She had not been that way when her father was shot. Could\\r\\nshe find the answer to the last question in the way she had put it?\\r\\nDesperately wounded! Had she, until hope flowed back into her heart,\\r\\nbeen that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she heard a concerned, far-away voice say. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been too\\r\\nmuch for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fought against a wave of faintness before she answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose\\r\\nso. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s--silly of me. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m all right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no joke to be buried in an avalanche. Hello! Look there!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer gaze followed the direction in which he was pointing, the edge of\\r\\nthe bluff above. Two men were looking down from the place where the\\r\\nslide had started. It was too far to recognize them, but one carried a\\r\\nrifle. They stood there for a minute or two before they withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think--that they--?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis grave eyes met hers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think they attempted murder, and, thank\\r\\nGod! failed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything to Dad--not now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cautioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded assent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed had looked at his watch just before the avalanche had come down on\\r\\nthem. The time was then ten o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock. It was past two before the outfit\\r\\nwas patched up sufficiently to travel again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot till they were safely out of the hills and gliding into Paradise\\r\\nValley did the cowman ask a question that had been in his mind for some\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do you reckon that slide came down at the very moment we were in\\r\\nthe ravine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been wonderin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about that my own se\\xe2\\x80\\x99f. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course, it might just\\r\\na-happened thataway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This from Forbes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might, but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeanin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was an explosion just before the slide started. Some one\\r\\ndynamited the comb to send it off the bluff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you guessin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, Clint? Or do you know it for a fact?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m guessing, but I pretty near know it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty spoke up, quietly, unexpectedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo do Mr. Hollister and I.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ranchmen pivoted simultaneously toward her. They waited, only\\r\\ntheir eyes asking the girl what she meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile you were digging, Mr. Hollister saw two men up there. He pointed\\r\\nthem out to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you show \\xe2\\x80\\x99em to me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat would you have done if I had?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she countered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDone! Gone up an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 found out who they were, though I could give a good\\r\\nguess right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do you think they would have let you come near? We could see that\\r\\none of them had a rifle. Maybe both had. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay there long,\\r\\nbut I was afraid every second that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d look up and see them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman grunted appreciation of her sagacity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome head she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngot, Clint. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d sure have started after them birds, me like as not\\r\\ntrailin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 after you. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d sure never have got to \\xe2\\x80\\x99em.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowman made no comment on that. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe timed it mighty close. Saw us\\r\\ncoming, of course, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 figured how long it would take us to reach where\\r\\nwe did. Good guessing. An old fox, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSame here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t miss smashing us twenty seconds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs it\\r\\nwas, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no kind of snowstorm to be out in without an umbrella and\\r\\novershoes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty looked at him and smiled faintly. It was all very well to joke\\r\\nabout it now, but they had missed being killed by a hair\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breadth. It\\r\\nmade her sick to think of that cackling little demon up there on the\\r\\nbluff plotting wholesale murder and almost succeeding in his plan. She\\r\\nlived over again with a bleak sinking of the heart that five minutes\\r\\nwhen she had not known whether Tug Hollister was dead or alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been killed! She knew herself now. Justin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instinct of\\r\\nselfishness had been right, after all. His niggardliness resolved\\r\\nitself into self-protection. He had been fighting for his own. Even\\r\\nhis jealousy stood justified. She had talked largely of friendship,\\r\\nhad deceived herself into thinking that it was expression of herself\\r\\nshe craved. That was true in a sense, but the more immediate blinding\\r\\ntruth was that she loved Hollister. It had struck her like a bolt of\\r\\nlightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt as helpless as a drowning man who has ceased struggling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\nWITHOUT RHYME OR REASON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an upsetting thing, this that had happened to Betty, as decided\\r\\nand far less explainable than a chemical reaction. It seemed to her as\\r\\nthough life had suddenly begun to move at tremendous speed, without any\\r\\nwarning to her whatever that Fate intended to step on the accelerator.\\r\\nShe was caught in the current of a stream of emotion sweeping down\\r\\nin flood. Though it gave her a great thrill, none the less it was\\r\\ndevastating.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wanted to escape, to be by herself behind a locked door, where she\\r\\ncould sit down, find herself again, and take stock of the situation.\\r\\nTo sit beside this stranger who had almost in the twinkling of an eye\\r\\nbecome of amazing import to her, to feel unavoidable contact of knee\\r\\nand elbow and shoulder, magnetic currents of attraction flowing, was\\r\\nalmost more than she could bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty talked, a little, because silence became too significant. She\\r\\nfelt a sense of danger, as though the personality, the individuality\\r\\nshe had always cherished, were being dissolved in the gulf where she\\r\\nwas sinking. But what she said, what Hollister replied, she could never\\r\\nafterward remember.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth ran to meet them with excited little screams of greeting.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoo-hoo, Daddy! Hoo-hoo, Betty! Oh, goody, goody!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister was out of the sled and had the child in her arms almost\\r\\nbefore the horses had stopped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou darling darling!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuxom Bridget came to the door, all smiles of welcome. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd is it your\\r\\nown self at last, Betty mavourneen? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glad we are to see you this\\r\\nday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty hugged her and murmured a request. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter fix up the south\\r\\nbedroom for Mr. Hollister. He ought to rest at once. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m kinda tired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look after him. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you worry your head about that.\\r\\nThe room\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all ready.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to question herself had to be postponed. She had\\r\\nreckoned without Ruth, who clung to her side until the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bedtime.\\r\\nPleading fatigue, Betty retired immediately after her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe slipped into a n\\xc3\\xa9glig\\xc3\\xa9e, let her dark hair down so that it fell a\\r\\nrippling cascade over her shoulders, and looked into the glass of her\\r\\ndressing-table that reflected a serious, lovely face of troubled youth.\\r\\nA queer fancy moved in her that this girl who returned her gaze was a\\r\\nstranger whom she was meeting for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid love play such tricks as this? Did it steal away self-confidence\\r\\nand leave one shy and gauche? She saw a pulse fluttering in the brown\\r\\nslender throat. That was odd too. Her nerves usually were steel-strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe combed her hair, braided it, and put on a cr\\xc3\\xaape-de-chine nightgown.\\r\\nAfter the light was out and she was between the sheets, her thoughts\\r\\nsettled to more orderly sequence. She could always think better in the\\r\\ndark, and just now she did not want to be distracted by any physical\\r\\nevidences of the disorder into which she had been flung.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could she ever have thought of marrying Justin? She had spent a\\r\\ngood deal of time trying to decide calmly, without any agitation of the\\r\\nblood, whether she was in love with him. It was no longer necessary\\r\\nfor her to puzzle over how a girl would know whether she cared for a\\r\\nman. She knew. It was something in nature, altogether outside of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nself, that took hold of one without rhyme or reason and played havoc\\r\\nwith dispassionate tranquillity; a devouring flame clean and pure,\\r\\ncontaining within itself all the potentialities of tragedy--of life, of\\r\\ndeath, of laughter, love and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, as is the way of healthy youth, in the midst of her\\r\\npuzzlement she was asleep--and with no lapse of time, as though a\\r\\ncurtain had rolled up, she was opening her eyes to a new day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Tug had let himself count on long full hours with Betty in the\\r\\npleasant living-room, of books and ideas to be discussed together, of\\r\\ncasual words accented to meaning by tones of the voice and flashes of\\r\\nthe eye, he was predestined to disappointment. In the hill cabin they\\r\\nhad been alone together a good deal. She contrived to see that this\\r\\nnever occurred now. Except at table or in the evening with Ruth and her\\r\\nfather, he caught only glimpses of her as she moved about her work.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes did not avoid his, but they did not meet in the frank,\\r\\ndirect way characteristic of her. She talked and laughed, joined\\r\\nin the give-and-take of care-free conversation. To put into words\\r\\nthe difference was not easy. What he missed was the note of deep\\r\\nunderstanding that had been between them, born less of a common point\\r\\nof view than of a sympathy of feeling. Betty had definitely withdrawn\\r\\ninto herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he offended her? He could not think how, but he set himself to find\\r\\nout. It took some contriving, for when one will and one will not a\\r\\nprivate meeting is not easily arranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in the big family room, lying on a lounge in the sunshine of the\\r\\nsouth window. Ruth had finished her lessons and was on the floor busy\\r\\nwith a pair of scissors and a page of magazine cutouts. She babbled on,\\r\\nhalf to herself and half to him. They had become great friends, and\\r\\nfor the time she was his inseparable, perhaps because he was the only\\r\\none of the household not too busy to give her all the attention she\\r\\ncraved. Her talk, frank with the egotism of childhood, was wholly of\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI been awful bad to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she confided cheerfully, almost proudly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in Bridget\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flour bin \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ev\\xe2\\x80\\x99ryfing to make a cake \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nspillin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a crock o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 milk on the floor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I been the baddest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she reflected aloud enjoyably. Then,\\r\\nunhampered by any theory of self-determination, she placed the blame\\r\\nplacidly where it belonged, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I said my prayers last night I asked\\r\\nGod to make me good, but he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug did not probe deeper into this interesting point of view, for Betty\\r\\ncame into the room with an armful of books and magazines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThought from what you said at breakfast you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hungry for reading,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I brought you some. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like I am, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to\\r\\nbrowse around a bit before you settle down. This Tarkington story is\\r\\ngood--if you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t read it. But maybe you like Conrad better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the open door came a delicious odor of fresh baking from the\\r\\nkitchen. Out of the corner of his eye Tug took in Ruth. He sniffed the\\r\\nspicy aroma and audibly sounded his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy! Cookies!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly Ruth responded to the suggestion. She scrambled to her feet\\r\\nand trotted out, intent on achieving cookies at once. Betty turned to\\r\\nfollow, but her guest stopped her with a question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Tarkington story about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout a girl who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hanging on to the outskirts of society and making\\r\\nall kinds of pretenses--a pushing kind of a girl, who has to fib and\\r\\nscheme to get along. But he makes her so human you like her and feel\\r\\nsorry for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSounds interesting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He fired his broadside while he still held her\\r\\neyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Reed, why am I being punished?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInto her cheeks the color flowed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPunished?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured, taken aback.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty had stopped by the table and half turned. He reached for the\\r\\numbrella he used as a support and hobbled toward her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. What have I\\r\\ndone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA turmoil of the blood began to boil in her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe doctor said you were\\r\\nto keep off your feet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she evaded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and he said you were to entertain me--keep me interested.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was when you were too sick to read. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m busy now. Lots of\\r\\nwork piled up while I was away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not offended about anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had picked up a book from the table and was reading the title. Her\\r\\neyes did not lift to his. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat could I be--offended about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In spite\\r\\nof the best she could do, her voice was a little tremulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. _Are_ you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The lashes fluttered up. She had to meet his gaze or confess that\\r\\nshe was afraid to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re different. You--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped, struck dumb. A wild hope flamed up in him. What was it\\r\\nthe shy, soft eyes were telling him against her will? He stood on the\\r\\nthreshold of knowledge, his heart drumming fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring that moment of realization they were lost in each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\nThe soul of each was drawn as by a magnet out of the body to that\\r\\nregion beyond space where the spirits of lovers are fused.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands lifted ever so slightly in a gesture of ultimate and\\r\\npassionate surrender to this force which had taken hold of her so\\r\\ncompletely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with no conscious volition on the part of either, they were in\\r\\neach other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arms, swept there by a rising tide of emotion that drowned\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLUEBIRD ALIGHTS AND THEN TAKES WING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTug pushed Betty from him. Out of a full tide of feeling he came to\\r\\nconsciousness of what he was doing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered hoarsely.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe understood only that something in his mind threatened their\\r\\nhappiness. Her eyes clung to his. She waited, breathless, still under\\r\\nthe spell of their great moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t what?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at last she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ... marry you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He struggled for expression, visibly in anguish.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ... outside the pale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow--outside the pale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made it impossible. We met too late.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not--married?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ... I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He stuck, and started again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know. My vice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took her a moment to remember what it was. To her it was something\\r\\ndone with ages ago in that pre-millennial past before they had found\\r\\neach other. She found no conceivable relationship between it and this\\r\\nmiracle which had befallen them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut--I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flashed a star-eyed, wordless question at him, born of a swift and\\r\\npanicky fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touched it--not since I went into the hills. But--I\\r\\nmight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat nonsense! Of course, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do I know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too silly to think about. Why should you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a matter of reason. I tried to stop before, and I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you stopped this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had the headaches. Suppose they began again. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nfierce--as though the top of my head were being sawed off. If they came\\r\\nback--what then? How do I know I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn to the drug for relief?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if they did?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave him both her hands. There were gifts in her eyes--of faith, of\\r\\nsplendid scorn for the vice he had trodden underfoot, of faith profound\\r\\nand sure. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they do come back, dear, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fight them together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was touched, deeply. There was a smirr of mist obscuring his vision.\\r\\nHer high sweet courage took him by the throat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like you. I\\r\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay you a better compliment if I hunted the world over for\\r\\none. But I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let you in for the possibility of such a thing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be\\r\\na rotten cad to do it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to buck it through alone. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\nprice I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to pay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe price for what?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor having been a weakling: for having yielded to it before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou never were a weakling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she protested indignantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nresponsible. It was nothing but an effect of your wounds. The doctors\\r\\ngave it to you because you had to have it. You used it to dull the\\r\\nhorrible pain. When the pain stopped and you were cured, you quit\\r\\ntaking it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all there is to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled ruefully, though he was deadly in earnest. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou make it sound\\r\\nas simple as a proposition in geometry. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid, dear, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nas easily disposed of as that. I started to take it for my headaches,\\r\\nbut I kept on taking it regularly whether I needed it for the pain or\\r\\nnot. I was a drug victim. No use dodging that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the truth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, say you were. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not now. You never will be again. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d--I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nstake my head on it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Because you are _you_. And your faith would help\\r\\nme--tremendously. But I know the horrible power of the thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an\\r\\nobsession. When the craving was on me, it was there every second. I\\r\\nfound myself looking for all sorts of plausible excuses to give way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any real power. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve proved that by breaking away from it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve regained my health from the hills and from my work. That stopped\\r\\nthe trouble with my head. But how do I know it has stopped permanently?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWise beyond her years, she smiled tenderly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mentioned faith a\\r\\nminute ago. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. We have to live by that. A thousand times a day\\r\\nwe depend on it. We rely on the foundations of the house not to crumble\\r\\nand let it bury us. I never ride a horse without assuming that it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nkick me. We have to have the courage of our hopes, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor ourselves, yes. But we ought not to invite those we love into the\\r\\nhouse unless we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sure of the foundations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure enough. And, anyhow, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a poor cold sort of philosophy.\\r\\nI want to be where _you_ are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The slim, straight figure, the dusky,\\r\\ngallant little head, the eyes so luminous and quick, reproached with\\r\\ntheir eagerness his prudent caution. She offered him the greatest gift\\r\\nin the world, and he hung back with _ifs_ and _buts_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was in him something that held at bay what he wanted more than\\r\\nanything else on earth. He could not brush aside hesitations with her\\r\\nmagnificent scorn. He had lost the right to do it. His generosity would\\r\\nbe at her expense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you knew, dear, how much I want you. If you knew! But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to\\r\\nthink of you, to protect you from myself. Oh, Betty, why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I meet\\r\\nyou two years ago?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His voice was poignant as a wail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met me now. If you really want me--well, here I\\r\\nam.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there, the sweetest girl ever God made--and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here a\\r\\nthousand miles away from you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot unless you think so, Tug,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered softly, her dusky eyes\\r\\ninviting him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made me love you. What are you going to do with\\r\\nme?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to see you get the squarest deal I can give you, no matter\\r\\nwhat it costs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCosts you or me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound in his throat was almost a groan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear heart, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m torn in\\r\\ntwo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be, Tug.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her tender eyes and wistfully smiling lips were very\\r\\nclose to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just as _sure_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to play the game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said miserably.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty talked, pleaded, argued with him, but his point of view remained\\r\\nunchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nA reaction of irritation swept her. It was in part offended modesty.\\r\\nShe had offered herself, repeatedly, and he would not have her. How did\\r\\nshe know that he was giving the true reason? It might be only a tactful\\r\\nway of getting rid of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlay it then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied curtly, and she walked out of the room\\r\\nwithout another look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was astounded, shocked. He had been to blame, of course, in ever\\r\\nletting his love leap out and surprise them. Probably he had not made\\r\\nclear to her the obligation that bound him not to let her tie up her\\r\\nlife with his. He must see her at once and make her understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this he could not do. A note dispatched by Ruth brought back the\\r\\nverbal message that she was busy. At supper Betty did not appear. The\\r\\nspecious plea was that she had a headache. Nor was she at breakfast.\\r\\nFrom Bridget he gathered that she had gone to the Quarter Circle D E\\r\\nand would stay there several days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 after some fencing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the housekeeper explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat gir-rl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\na wonder if iver there was one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug agreed to that, but it was in his mind that the fencing would have\\r\\nhad to wait if affairs had not come to a crisis between him and Betty.\\r\\nHe had no intention of keeping her from her home. Over the telephone he\\r\\nmade arrangements to stay at the Wild Horse House. Clint, perplexed and\\r\\na little disturbed in mind, drove him to town.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the way they covered in silence. Just before they reached the\\r\\nvillage, Reed came to what was in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Betty had any trouble, Hollister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe younger man considered this a moment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo trouble; that is, not\\r\\nexactly trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high-headed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father said, rather by way of explanation than\\r\\napology. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the salt of the earth. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you make any mistake\\r\\nabout that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be likely to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his guest said quietly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the finest\\r\\ngirl I ever met.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowman looked quickly at him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid she go to the Quarter Circle D E\\r\\nbecause of anything that took place between you an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added a moment later an explanation: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI let her see\\r\\nhow much I thought of her. It slipped out. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meant to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed was still puzzled. He knew his daughter liked the young fellow by\\r\\nhis side. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid that make her mad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I found out she cared for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean--?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The face of the engineer flushed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a complete surprise to\\r\\nme. I had thought my feelings wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter because she would never\\r\\nfind out about them. When she did--and told me that she--cared for me,\\r\\nI had to tell her where I stand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust where do you stand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t marry. You must know why.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nClint flicked the whip and the young team speeded. When he had steadied\\r\\nthem to a more sedate pace, he spoke. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon I do. But--you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given\\r\\nit up, haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He qualified the affirmative. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not the first man who thought\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d given it up and hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGot doubts about it, have you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done with the cursed stuff. But how do I know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tug\\r\\nwent into details as to the nature of the disease. He finished with a\\r\\nsentence that was almost a cry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather see her dead than married\\r\\nto a victim of that habit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did Betty say to that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d expect her to say. She wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe there was any danger.\\r\\nWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it for a minute. You know how generous she is. Then,\\r\\nwhen I insisted on it, she seemed to think it was an excuse and walked\\r\\nout of the room. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen her since. She wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let me have a\\r\\nchance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see as there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much you could say--unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to\\r\\nrenig.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice took on a trace of resentment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeems to me, young\\r\\nfellow, it was up to you not to let things get as far as they did\\r\\nbetween you an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Betty. That wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hardly a square deal for her. You\\r\\nget her to tell you how she feels to you, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then you turn her down. I\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that a-tall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug did not try to defend himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one way of looking at it. I\\r\\nought never to have come to the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with humility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But wishing don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get us anywhere. Point is, what\\r\\nare we going to do about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see anything to do. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take the first train out if it would\\r\\nhelp any,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister replied despondently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you go. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a talk with her an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 see how she feels first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister promised not to leave until he had heard from Reed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nBORN THAT WAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was impossible for Betty to escape the emotions that flooded her,\\r\\nbut she was the last girl to sit down and accept defeat with folded\\r\\nhands. There was in her a certain vigor of the spirit that craved\\r\\nexpression, that held her head up in the face of disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Quarter Circle D E she was so briskly businesslike that none\\r\\nof the men would have guessed that she was passing through a crisis.\\r\\nExcept for moments of abstraction, she gave no evidence of the waves\\r\\nof emotion that inundated her while she was giving orders about the\\r\\nfencing of the northwest forty or the moving of the pigpens.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was alone, it was worse. Her longing for Hollister became\\r\\nacute. If she could see him, talk with him, his point of view would\\r\\nbe changed. New arguments marshaled themselves in her mind. It was\\r\\nridiculous to suppose that a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past--one not of his own choosing,\\r\\nbut forced on him--could determine his future so greatly as to make\\r\\nhappiness impossible. She would not believe it. Every instinct of her\\r\\nvirile young personality rebelled against the acceptance of such a law.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persistence in renouncing joy had wounded her vanity. But at\\r\\nbottom she did not doubt him. He had stood out because he thought it\\r\\nright, not because he did not love her. In spite of her distress of\\r\\nmind, she was not quite unhappy. A warm hope nestled in her bosom. She\\r\\nloved and was loved. The barrier between them would be torn down.\\r\\nAgain they would be fused into that oneness which for a blessed ten\\r\\nminutes had absorbed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father drove over in the rattletrap car. Ostensibly he had come\\r\\nto discuss with her plans for fertilization and crops of the Quarter\\r\\nCircle D E for the coming season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI took Hollister to town this morning. He wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay any longer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nReed presently mentioned, as though casually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he stay?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty was rather proud of the indifference\\r\\nshe contrived to convey in her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaid he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to keep you away from home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas he keeping me away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeemed to think so. Wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see you know all about it, Dad. What did he tell you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI asked him point-blank what the trouble was between you and him. He\\r\\ntold me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA faint crimson streamed into her cheeks. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did he say it was?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s afraid. Not for himself, but for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awf\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly silly of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not so sure about that, Bettykins. If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s any doubt whatever,\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better wait till he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He let his arm fall across her\\r\\nshoulders with a gentleness she knew to be a caress. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you found\\r\\nthe man you want, dear? Sure about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled ruefully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure enough, Dad. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one that seems in\\r\\ndoubt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To this she added a reply to a sentence earlier in his period.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything to me about waiting. His \\xe2\\x80\\x98No, thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was\\r\\nquite definite, I thought.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nClint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrath began to simmer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a notion that he can take\\r\\nor leave you as he pleases--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty put a hand on his arm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, Dad. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean what I said.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not fair to him. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no man in the Rockies good enough for you--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you taking in enough territory?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she teased, her face bubbling to\\r\\nmirth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re including Denver. Justin came\\r\\nfrom there, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too good for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too good?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo perfect, then. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live up to him. Never in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her\\r\\neyes fixed on something in the distance. She watched for a moment or\\r\\ntwo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalking about angels, Dad. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the flutter of his engine fan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReed turned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick was killing the engine of his runabout. He came across to them,\\r\\nruddy, strong, well-kept. Every stride expressed the self-reliant and\\r\\ncomplacent quality of his force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart beat faster. She had not seen him since that moment,\\r\\nmore than two weeks ago, when they had parted in anger. Her resentment\\r\\nagainst him had long since died. He had not been to blame because\\r\\nthey were incompatible in point of view and temperament. It was\\r\\ncharacteristic of her that she had written to ask him to forgive her if\\r\\nshe had in any way done him a wrong. If she could, she wanted to keep\\r\\nhim for a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook hands with them. Reed asked about the work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve finished the tunnel and are laying the line of the main canal\\r\\nbetween it and the draw where it runs into Elk Creek Ca\\xc3\\xb1on. Soon as\\r\\nthe ground is thawed out, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have dirt flying on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLots of water in the dam?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the cowman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFull up. The mild weather this last week has raised it a lot. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\na great deal of snow in the hills. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have no difficulty about a\\r\\nsufficient supply.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got old Jake Prowers beat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustin has done a big thing for this part of the country. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more\\r\\nimportant than beating Mr. Prowers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed Merrick impersonally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, the old fellow is\\r\\nstill nursing his fancied injuries. He was hanging around the dam\\r\\nyesterday. I warned him off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay anything?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Clint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTittered the way he does and congratulated me on the good job I had\\r\\ndone. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a venomous old snake, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that he can do us any\\r\\nharm. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing left to do now but the detail work of putting in\\r\\nthe ditches.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked for a few minutes about the irrigation project. The\\r\\nengineer did not betray the least self-consciousness, but his mind,\\r\\ntoo, was running on the last time he had seen Betty and the break\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed was called away by one of the men to look at a sick horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steady gaze at once challenged Betty. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got your letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a good deal less composed than he. It disconcerted her to know\\r\\nthat she was blushing. That was a silly way to do, she told herself. It\\r\\nannoyed her to give an exhibition of gaucherie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to the conclusion that we made a mistake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nrushed into a decision too hastily.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re young. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t given enough consideration to that. Shall we\\r\\nforget our differences and be as we were, Betty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean--be engaged?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what I mean.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Justin, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I thought you meant we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d made a mistake in ever\\r\\nbeing engaged. We did. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not suited to each other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree with you. Your letter convinced me that we are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean it that way at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said unhappily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not,\\r\\nJustin. Not a bit. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too--too kinda wild for you. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want a\\r\\nwife like me. If you knew, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want me a bit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the best judge of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, smiling a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d always be troubling you with my crazy ways.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re young,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m born that way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always be like that. Besides--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nstopped, searching for a way to put it gently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want a\\r\\nhusband--if I ever marry at all--who needs me, who has to have me, who\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get along without me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI need you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Not really. You think you do, maybe, but not in the\\r\\nway I mean. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re strong--self-sufficient. Please, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean it\\r\\nin an uncomplimentary way. But you _are_ big, you know. A wife would\\r\\nhave to fit into you--be just a--an important detail of your life. I\\r\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be everything to a man--help him--talk\\r\\nover his difficulties with him--be just the biggest thing in the world\\r\\nto him. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really _do_ anything for you. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re complete. You\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need anything done for you. With or without me, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to\\r\\nbe awf\\xe2\\x80\\x99ly successful. Oh, I know it sounds silly, but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you mean you like me less because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m reliable and efficient\\r\\nand--well, I take your own word--on the road to success? Would you want\\r\\nto marry an irresponsible failure?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe allusion was plain, and she did not like him better for it. None\\r\\nthe less, she recognized that this man, standing there in the quiet\\r\\narrogance of strength, had qualities admirable and worthy of great\\r\\nrespect. He was master of himself and, so far as one can be, of his\\r\\ndestinies. The cleft chin, the square jaw, the cold gray eyes so keen\\r\\nand steady, expressed character, and of a kind that would take him far.\\r\\nBut it was a road she would not travel with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to know that I was a help to my husband in making\\r\\nhis success. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand, Justin. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not what you want--not\\r\\nat all. If you saw me as I am, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d know it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d always be affronting\\r\\nyour sense of the fitting thing. The right wife for you is one who\\r\\nwould sit at the head of your table well-dressed, handsome, and\\r\\ncharming, an evidence of your standing in the community. You know--a\\r\\ngracious hostess, good at teas and bridge and that sort of thing.\\r\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really a city man. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a city woman and never shall be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Merrick, clear-eyed in spite of his fondness for her, came a flash\\r\\nof insight that told him she had been wiser than he. He could never\\r\\nmould this wildling to his heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire. Some day he would look\\r\\nback on this episode and smile at it. But he had not reached that\\r\\nstate of philosophy yet. His vanity was still engaged, and more than\\r\\nthat--the last passionate flame of the boy in him that was being\\r\\nsacrificed to ambition. He craved inordinately the willful charm of\\r\\nthis devastatingly sweet girl with the quick, disturbing eyes. She\\r\\nrepresented to him certain values he was deliberately trampling down,\\r\\nnot because they did not seem to him good, but because they warred with\\r\\nsomething that he wanted more. He had impossibly dreamed that she might\\r\\nstay what she was and yet become something different.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you going to marry Hollister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe might reasonably have told him this was a private matter of her\\r\\nown. She might have evaded the question. Instead, she told him the\\r\\ntruth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas he asked you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you will if he does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnowing what he has been, what he may be again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnowing what he is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill girls never get over the folly of marrying men to reform them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe flung out impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not marrying him to reform him--that is, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m marrying him at\\r\\nall, which isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t likely. He does not need reforming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you know he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slide back into his vice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He answered his\\r\\nown query. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way of knowing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She said it quietly, with absolute conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer attitude tremendously irritated him. It was a reflection on all the\\r\\ncopybook virtues that had made him what he was. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you waiting for\\r\\nthis tramp, this drug fiend, to make up his mind whether he wants to\\r\\nmarry you or not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a spark of anger in her eye. She would not modify even his\\r\\nphrasing. It could stand as he put it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSheer perversity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she agreed, with dangerous sweetness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew he was being punished for having indulged himself, as he rarely\\r\\ndid, in a display of temper. At once he took himself in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m serious about this, Betty. A girl has no right to take chances of\\r\\nthis sort. I grant you Hollister has qualities--splendid ones. But the\\r\\ndamning fact remains.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty relented. He was human. He had cried out because he was hurt.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it remains, Justin. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m absolutely convinced that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconquered--what you call his vice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I call his vice! Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t every sane person call it that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot if they knew the circumstances. He was left with terrible pains\\r\\nin the head after he was wounded. They gave him morphine--a lot of it.\\r\\nHe got to depending on it. The habit grew on him. Then he woke up and\\r\\nshook it off. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to his credit rather than the reverse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven so. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a danger that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go back to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again she denied it, with the certainty of one who does not need\\r\\nevidence to bulwark an absolute assurance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo danger at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were standing in front of the porch. Reed came toward them from\\r\\nthe stable. Both knew that the last word had been said.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Merrick struggled with himself a moment, then held out his hand.\\r\\nHe did not want to be a poor loser.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe best of luck, Betty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGladness gleamed in the soft eyes through which the eager spirit seemed\\r\\nto yearn to comfort him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, too, Justin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\nBIRDS OF A FEATHER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat on opposite sides of a table, the food and dishes not yet\\r\\ncleared away after their supper. A cheap kerosene lamp lit the room\\r\\ninsufficiently. The smoke from a ragged wick had entirely blackened\\r\\none side of the glass chimney. One of the men had cunningly utilized\\r\\nthis to throw the face of his companion into the light while his own\\r\\nremained in shadow. His bleached eyes watched the emotions come and go\\r\\nas they registered on the twisted, wolfish countenance of this criminal\\r\\non the dodge. He was playing on his evil instincts as a musician does\\r\\nupon the strings of a violin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe, I said right away, soon as I seen you, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This Cig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no quitter;\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go through.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So I tied up with you. Game, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 no mollycoddle.\\r\\nTha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how I sized you up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou got me right, Prowers. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man with the leathery face watched his victim. In the back\\r\\nof his mind a dreadful thought had lodged and become fixed. He would\\r\\nuse for his purpose this vain and shallow crook, then blot him out of\\r\\nlife before he turned upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I know it? Cig ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t roostin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up here for his health, I says to\\r\\nmyself. Not none, by jiminy by jinks. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBusiness is right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed the New Yorker. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 soon as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done, I\\r\\nain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stickin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 around dis dump no more. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m duckin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for \\xe2\\x80\\x99Frisco. But\\r\\nget it straight, Prowers. I taken all de chances I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna take alone.\\r\\nSee? An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll cost you two hundred iron men for my share of de job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot that much, Cig. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve both got our reasons for wantin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to pull\\r\\nthis off. Clint Reed an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 his foreman ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly friends of yours.\\r\\nYou got yore own account to settle. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll dig up a hundred. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntake you to \\xe2\\x80\\x99Frisco.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCig looked at his mild vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis sullenly. This harmless-looking old\\r\\nfellow was his master in villainy, more thorough, more ruthless.\\r\\nThere were times when his bleached eyes became ice-coated, when the\\r\\nNew Yorker had sensed back of them the crouched threat of the coiled\\r\\nrattlesnake. If he had known what Prowers was thinking now, he would\\r\\nhave shuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome generous guy, youse are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he sneered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 how do I know youse\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rap on me--t\\xe2\\x80\\x99row me down when de rubes make de big holler after\\r\\nde job?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old cattleman was at his suave mildest. No malignity showed in his\\r\\nsmile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reckon I can give no written guarantee, Cig, but I\\r\\nnever sawed off trouble yet on a fellow takin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the trail with me. Those\\r\\nwho have rode with me could tell you that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crook from the East was uneasy. He did not know why. His\\r\\nrestlessness drove him to the door of the cabin from which he looked\\r\\nout upon a cynical moon riding high above the tops of the pines. He\\r\\nshivered. This bleak world of white appalled his city-cramped spirit.\\r\\nIt had been bad enough in summer. Now it was infinitely worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hoodoo on me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he growled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s de Gawd-forsaken\\r\\ncountry that puts a jinx on me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m losin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me noive. Every job I tackle\\r\\nis a flivver. After dis one, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s me for de bright lights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. A getaway for you, pronto.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen do we get busy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerrick has left two watchmen at the\\r\\ndam. One of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em lives at Wild Horse. His wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sick. He got a call\\r\\nhalf an hour ago sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she was worse. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the trail for town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeavin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 one guy on de job. Do we bump him off?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot necessary. A quart of bootleg whiskey reached him this afternoon.\\r\\nTime we get there, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be dead to the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou sent de booze?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerrick didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers answered, with his impish grin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t on de wagon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDead sure. He can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave it alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like a lead pipe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut de jinx on me--When I\\r\\ngunned dat Tug Hollister I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 swore I got him good. Nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 works.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJake could not quite forbear sarcasm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ought to take one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 these\\r\\nhere correspondence courses in efficiency. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be different to-night,\\r\\nthough. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used to fallin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 down on anything I go after.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeanin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that I do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cig demanded sourly out of the corner of a\\r\\ndrooping mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeanin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been lucky lately. Let it go at that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers moved about making his preparations. The dynamite and the fuses\\r\\nalready made ready were put in a gunny-sack. The tools were packed.\\r\\nBeneath his coat Jake put on a gaberdine vest, for it was possible that\\r\\nthe weather might turn cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently both men were ready. The cattleman blew out the light and\\r\\nthey passed from the cabin into the starry night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not go direct to the dam. Prowers had in him too much of the\\r\\nfox for that. He would not leave tracks in the snow that might later\\r\\ntake him to the penitentiary. Their footsteps followed the beaten trail\\r\\nthat ran from the cabin to a road meandering down into Paradise Valley\\r\\nby the line of least resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf a mile from the point where they struck it, another road deflected\\r\\nfrom this one, leading to Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camp at the Sweetwater Dam. Into\\r\\nthis they turned. The snow had been beaten down by scores of passing\\r\\nfeet. The top crust did not break beneath their weights, so that no\\r\\nevidence would be left written there as to who had made this midnight\\r\\ntrip of destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye took in the ghostly white hills and he shivered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGawd, what\\r\\na dump!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he groaned. His vocabulary was as limited as his emotions.\\r\\nHe could never get used to the barren grandeur of the Rockies. They\\r\\nawed and oppressed him. They were too stark and clean for him. He\\r\\nstruggled with a sense of doom. In cities he never thought of death,\\r\\nbut premonitions of it had several times shaken his ratlike courage\\r\\nsince he had been here. Twice he had dreamed that he was being buried\\r\\nin these hills and had wakened in a cold sweat of horror. He made up\\r\\nhis mind to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeat it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the Pacific coast at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came down into the bowl where the dam was, skirting the edge\\r\\nof the timber to attract as little attention as possible in case\\r\\na watchman should be on his beat. No sign of life disturbed the\\r\\nstillness. They crept to the tents and made a hurried survey. In one\\r\\nof them a man lay on a cot asleep. He was fully dressed. His arms were\\r\\noutflung and he was breathing stertorously. A bottle, one third full,\\r\\nstood on a small table close to the cot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike I said, dead to the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prowers commented.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned away. Cig swiftly snatched the bottle and slipped it inside\\r\\nhis coat. He wanted a drink or two pretty badly, and, like enough,\\r\\nProwers wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let him have them if he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men crossed the dam-head to the gates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the cowman said as he put down the gunny-sack.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they set to work, Cig concealed his bottle, but in the course\\r\\nof the hours that followed he made frequent visits to the spot where\\r\\nhe had hidden it. Since Prowers was neither blind nor a fool he became\\r\\naware of what the other was trying to keep from him. He said nothing.\\r\\nThe bulk of the work fell on him. No complaint came from his lips.\\r\\nThere was a curious smile on them, ironic, cruel, and unhuman.\\r\\n\\r\\nCig was in turn gay, talkative, maudlin, and drowsy. His boastings died\\r\\naway. He propped himself against the cement wall close to the gates and\\r\\nswayed sleepily. Once or twice he cat-napped for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man continued to prepare the charges. Once, watching his\\r\\naccomplice, he broke into a cackle of mocking mirth, so sinister that\\r\\nCig would have shuddered if he had been alive to impressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp slid down to a sitting posture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDone up. Shleep a li\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x99f you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99 min\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he was in a drunken slumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers finished his work and lit the fuses. He looked at the weak and\\r\\nvicious instrument he had been using, a horrible grin on his leathery,\\r\\nwrinkled face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or stayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked squeakily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doomed man snored.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuit yoreself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the little devil-man said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see you\\r\\nagain, good-bye. I got to be hittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the trail right lively.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved briskly along the great wall of the dam, climbed the steps\\r\\nat the far end, and followed the road leading out of the basin. Once\\r\\nhe turned to look at the deep lake lying placidly behind the rampart\\r\\nMerrick had built to hold it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great flash and roar filled the night. Even where Prowers stood, he\\r\\nfelt the shake of the earth. Masses of torn concrete, of rock and sand,\\r\\nwere flung into the air. The echoes of the explosion died, but another\\r\\nsound reached the anarchist on the hillside. He listened, with the\\r\\ndiabolical grin on his lips, to a murmur of rushing waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sweetwater Dam was going out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Flat Tops are liable to be irrigated good an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plenty, looks like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe murmured. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, this is no place for sight-seers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shuffled along the trail, the Satanic smile still on his leathery\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have vanished promptly if he had known that a pair of eyes\\r\\nwere looking down on him from the shadow of a pine above the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nA STORMY SEA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty, about to return to the Quarter Circle D E, found herself\\r\\nimportuned by her small sister to take her along.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the goodest, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 not bovver you, \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 go to bed jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the minute\\r\\nyou say to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she promised.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older sister hesitated, then turned to her father. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nstaying there only one night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFine. Take Little Nuisance along,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reed said, and poked a forefinger\\r\\ninto Ruth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s softly padded body. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go to town, anyhow, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be back till late.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly two weeks since Betty had shaken hands with Justin\\r\\nMerrick and closed in good-will a chapter of her history. She had not\\r\\nseen Tug Hollister since then, but word had reached her that he had\\r\\ngone back to work in the hills. Merrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s men were on the Flat Tops\\r\\nrunning the lines where the ditches were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was waiting for Tug to come to her. Surely he did not intend to let\\r\\nthings end between them as they were. He would ride up some day and\\r\\ntell her that he had been a stiff-necked idiot who had at last seen the\\r\\nlight. Every day she had looked for him, and her eyes had moved up the\\r\\nroad in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pleasant sunshine Ruth prattled cheerfully of puppies, dolls,\\r\\ngingerbread, Sunday school, her new pink dress, and warts. Betty came\\r\\nout of a brown reverie at the name of Hollister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI fink he might come an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 see us. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as mad at him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the child\\r\\nannounced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99N\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna tell him so, too, when he comes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he comes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty found herself saying with a little sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew that if he did not make the first move she would take the\\r\\ninitiative herself. A little point of pride was not going to stand in\\r\\nthe way of her happiness. But she believed he ought to come to her. It\\r\\nwas a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place to meet a girl more than halfway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, of course, some fantastic sense of duty that was holding him\\r\\nback. She had not very much patience with it. Why was he not generous\\r\\nenough to give her a chance to be generous about this fault he\\r\\nmagnified so greatly? He did not seem to appreciate her point of view\\r\\nat all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk at the Quarter Circle D E an unopened letter lay\\r\\nawaiting her. She had never seen Hollister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writing, but at the first\\r\\nglance after she picked up the envelope her heart began to hammer. She\\r\\nknew who the message was from. The postmark was Wild Horse. Evidently\\r\\nthe mailman had delivered it an hour or two earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tore the flap and read:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ever since I saw you last I have been close to happiness in spite of\\r\\n  my distress. You love me. I tell myself that over and over. I cling\\r\\n  to it and rest in it. For this is the greatest thing that ever came\\r\\n  into my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I wish, dear, dear friend, that I could show you my heart. I wish you\\r\\n  could understand how great is the temptation to throw away discretion\\r\\n  and accept this wonderful gift. A thousand times I have been over the\\r\\n  ground, trying to persuade myself that you are right and my caution a\\r\\n  coward\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fear with no basis in reason. But I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Before I\\r\\n  dared to take your life into my keeping, I would have to be sure. And\\r\\n  how can I be? How can I _know_ that this horrible thing won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rise up\\r\\n  some day and throttle your happiness?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Why did I not meet you before I had given hostages to this\\r\\n  destructive menace? I keep asking myself why. I can find no answer\\r\\n  that is not born in bitter mockery.\\r\\n\\r\\n  If you could know what you have done for me, how you have rebuilt my\\r\\n  faith in good, in God! No man ever had so wonderful a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was all, except the signature at the bottom. But it made her heart\\r\\nsing. Her doubts were at rest. He loved her. That was all she wanted to\\r\\nknow. The difficulties in his mind would vanish. Her love would beat\\r\\nthem down. What scruples, what fears could stand against this joy that\\r\\nflooded them both?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to tell him so, to pour her heart out in what was to be the\\r\\nfirst love-letter she had ever written. Yet she was not impatient of\\r\\nthe delays forced on her by ranch details, by Ruth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imperious demands\\r\\nfor attention. She could attend to these competently and without\\r\\nirritation because subconsciously her being floated in happiness. Life\\r\\nhad always given Betty what she wanted. It was unthinkable that there\\r\\nshould be withheld from her that which was the crown of all her hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlone at the desk in the living-room, after everybody else on the\\r\\nranch had retired, Betty gave herself up to the luxury of dreams. She\\r\\nfelt very wide awake. It would not be possible to sleep until she had\\r\\nwritten an answer. There was no hurry about it. She wanted to take\\r\\nplenty of time to think out what she wanted to say before she even\\r\\nstarted on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she began to write, her thoughts flew fast. They kept busy the\\r\\nflashing finger-tips that transmitted the messages to the white page on\\r\\nthe carriage of the typewriter. The sentences were short, impulsive,\\r\\nenergetic. They expressed the surge of eagerness in her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew she would copy it in long hand, would go over every word of\\r\\nevery sentence. The other side of her, the shy-eyed maiden of dreams\\r\\nwho must be the wooed and not the wooer, would insist on deleting,\\r\\ntrimming down, making colorless the swift and passionate staccato of\\r\\nthe words. The letter she would send to Hollister would be pale and\\r\\nneutral compared to this cry of the heart she was uttering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little glass-cased clock on her desk struck two. Betty was\\r\\nsurprised. She had been here alone with her thoughts for four hours.\\r\\nThe fire in the grate had died down and the room was beginning to\\r\\nchill. She gathered the live coals and put upon them two split lengths\\r\\nof resinous pine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few minutes she sat before the blaze warming her hands. That was\\r\\nthe obvious reason for her staying. A more compelling one was that she\\r\\nsaw pictures in the coals, dream pictures of the future in which two\\r\\nfigures moved to the exclusion of all others. These had the texture of\\r\\nfiction, not consciously, but because our conceptions of the future\\r\\nmust always be adjusted to a reality affected by environment and human\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty lifted her head and listened. What was that rushing, swishing\\r\\nsound? She rose, startled, affected instantly by a sense of insecurity\\r\\nand danger. Something crashed heavily against the wall. The floor\\r\\nseemed to weave.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to the window and looked out into the darkness. A river, swift\\r\\nand turbid, was roaring past where the lawn had been a few minutes\\r\\nbefore. The girl stood terrified, her mind caught in the horror of\\r\\nunknown disaster. Even as she stood there, she saw that the waters were\\r\\nrising.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain there sounded a rending crash of timbers. Like a battering-ram\\r\\nthe end of a telephone pole smashed through the side of the house,\\r\\ncrossed the room, and came to rest in the fireplace. With it came a\\r\\nrush of water that covered the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty screamed. Her panicky heart beat wildly. Was the world coming\\r\\nto an end? She looked out again. What she saw was appalling--a swirl\\r\\nof rising waters tossing like the backs of cattle on a stampede. She\\r\\nnoticed that the barn, plainly visible a few moments before, had\\r\\nvanished from sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sloshing tide in the room was rising. Already it reached the\\r\\nbottom of her skirts. There was no longer any doubt that the floor was\\r\\ntilting. The house had been swept from its foundations. Built of frame,\\r\\nit was tossing on the face of a rough sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty waded to the stairway, climbing over the telephone pole. Except\\r\\nRuth and the old colored woman Mandy there was nobody in the house with\\r\\nher. Both of these were sleeping on the second floor. In the bunkhouse\\r\\nwere three men employed by her, but she realized that it, too, must\\r\\nhave been carried away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl flew upstairs from the pursuing flood. She knew now that\\r\\nit must have been caused by the breaking of the Sweetwater Dam. The\\r\\nQuarter Circle D E ran along a narrow valley down which must be pouring\\r\\nall the melted snow and rainfall impounded in the big reservoir.\\r\\n\\r\\nPounded by the impact of the descending waters, the house rocked like a\\r\\nboat. The lights had gone out when the wires had become disconnected,\\r\\nbut Betty groped her way into the room where her sister lay asleep in\\r\\nthe moonlight. She was running to pick up the child when Mandy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice\\r\\nstopped her. It came in an excited wail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDe day of judgment am hyeh, honey. Oh, Lawdy, Lawdy, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sure come\\r\\nto de River Jordan!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest bulwark of courage is responsibility. The old woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhelpless collapse steadied her. A moment before she had known no\\r\\nsensation but terror. Now there poured back into her the sense of\\r\\nobligation. She had two children on her hands, one old and one young.\\r\\nShe must be a rock upon which they could lean.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty stepped out of the room and closed the door in order not to waken\\r\\nRuth. She noticed that the two lower steps of the stairway were already\\r\\nsubmerged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone out, Mandy. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re caught in the flood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn despair Mandy threw up her brown palms. She was a short, fat woman\\r\\nwith an indistinguishable waist-line. A handkerchief was knotted round\\r\\nher head for a nightcap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis am shore de night of Armagideon when de four ho\\xe2\\x80\\x99semen of de\\r\\nEpolipse am a-ridin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Oh, Lawd, where am you at when pore black Mandy\\r\\nam a-reachin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fo\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you-all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA lurch of the house flung her against Betty. She clutched at the girl\\r\\nand clung to her. Her eyes rolled. She opened her mouth to scream.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty clapped her hand over it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop that nonsense, Mandy! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nnot have it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she ordered sharply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll waken Ruth. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all\\r\\nright so long as the house holds together. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not have any of your\\r\\nfoolishness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth closed. The words of Betty were astringent.\\r\\nThey assumed leadership, which was all that Mandy wanted. Her voice\\r\\nobediently abated to a whimper.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty did not open her mind to the colored woman. There was no use in\\r\\nfilling her with alarms she had not yet conjured up. But the girl knew\\r\\ntheir situation was desperate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the lower end of the rock-girt valley was a gateway where the\\r\\nhogbacks on either side of it came almost together. There was room\\r\\nenough for a wagon to get through and no more. Out of this gap all the\\r\\nwater rushing into the narrow basin would have to pour to the Flat Tops\\r\\nbelow. If the Sweetwater Dam had gone out--and of that Betty had no\\r\\ndoubt--the floods would race down for hours much faster than they could\\r\\nescape to the mesa. The churning stream would grow deeper instead of\\r\\nsubsiding. The house might waterlog and sink. It might turn over. It\\r\\nmight be rammed by trees or rocks. Or it might be beaten by the waves\\r\\nuntil it fell apart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going in to Ruth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming, too, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nhave to behave, Mandy. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not have you frightening her by any silly\\r\\nhysterics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYas\\xe2\\x80\\x99m,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assented Mandy meekly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth was still asleep, though the roar of the sweeping waters came\\r\\nthrough the open window and occasionally a drench of spray. Her sister\\r\\nwent to close the casement. Above, the moon was shining placidly;\\r\\nbelow, the current boiled and churned. The depth of the stream, Betty\\r\\nguessed, must be eight or ten feet. It was still rising, but the force\\r\\nof its downward rush was terrific.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house pitched like a boat. What was worse, it had tilted so that\\r\\nwater was pouring in at the lower windows. If the stream continued to\\r\\nrise, it would probably either sink or overturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of crashing timbers and beating waves continued. Betty\\r\\nwondered how much pounding an old frame building like this could stand.\\r\\nIt was built with an ell, the wing a later addition to the farmhouse.\\r\\nThe binding beams connecting the two parts creaked and groaned under\\r\\nthe strain put upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth woke. Betty sat down on the bed and put her arms round the child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat \\xe2\\x80\\x99tis?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the child, frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the water got out of the dam and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re floating in it, dearie.\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cry, Ruthie. Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be here with you all the time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a series of heavy bumps accompanied by the sound of rending\\r\\ntimbers. It was as though the floor was being torn from under their\\r\\nfeet. Betty thought they were going down. The house listed sharply,\\r\\nthen righted itself so suddenly that the girl was flung to the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house had been torn asunder, one wing from the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMandy and the child screamed. For a moment Betty was near panic\\r\\nherself. But she fought down her terror resolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee. The floor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her voice was steady and calm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nprobably be all right. Stop that noise, Mandy. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I tell you I\\r\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper sniffled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ce\\xe2\\x80\\x99tainly scared to death, honey, I\\r\\nshorely is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She folded her short, fat arms and rocked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI been a\\r\\nmighty triflin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nigger, but I aims frum now on to get shet uv my\\r\\nscandalacious ways an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 travel de road what leads to de pearly gates.\\r\\nYas\\xe2\\x80\\x99m. Glory Hallelujah! If de good Lawd evah lets me git outa hyeh\\r\\nalive, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll shout for salvation at de mourners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bench mighty loud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation was too desperate for Betty to find any amusement in\\r\\nMandy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good resolutions, but it occurred to her to turn some of her\\r\\nfear into another channel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove the booming of the wild waters she lifted her clear young\\r\\nsoprano and sang \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSafe in the Arms of Jesus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The first line she\\r\\ncarried alone, then Mandy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rich contralto quavered in and Ruth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small\\r\\npiping treble joined.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an impact that shook every timber the current flung the house\\r\\nagainst a great boulder. The building swung as on a pivot and was\\r\\ndriven into the rocks again. Betty looked out of the window. They were\\r\\nwedged between two great spars of red sandstone. The furious buffeting\\r\\nof the racing tide lifted their frail refuge and dropped it upon the\\r\\nsharp edges of the crags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re caught at the Steeples,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the girl told the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they could get out and climb the rock spires! But that was\\r\\nimpossible. The house was submerged almost to the second floor in the\\r\\nswashing torrent which surrounded it and dragged at it with a violence\\r\\nthey could feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the shipwrecked three sang. This time it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRock of Ages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThey held one another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands for comfort, and in their prayer, voiced\\r\\nthrough the words of the old hymn, they found a sustaining strength.\\r\\nPresently Mandy took up \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSwing Low, Sweet Chariot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the others came\\r\\nin with support.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty helped to wear away the long night with talk. She forced into\\r\\nher voice cheerfulness and courage, though there was not a minute of\\r\\nthe dark hours not filled with alarms. It would be morning soon, she\\r\\npromised. Daddy would come and get them, or Lon, or perhaps Justin\\r\\nMerrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s men who were camping on the Flat Tops. Then they would have\\r\\nfun talking it all over and telling how brave Ruth had been for not\\r\\ncrying (except just the teentiest time) like a silly little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter what to those in peril seemed an eternity of waiting, light\\r\\nsifted into the sky with a promise of the coming day. The darkness\\r\\nlifted and showed them a valley of wild and turbid waters. The Quarter\\r\\nCircle D E ranch had become a furious and rushing river flung back upon\\r\\nitself by the hogbacks which dammed its free course.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the darkness it had seemed that the menace of the flood had been\\r\\ntenfold increased by the unknown peril that lay back of the visible.\\r\\nBut in the light they could see too much. The force of the torrent\\r\\nwas appalling. It showed them to what a puny reed of safety they were\\r\\nclinging. At any moment the building might collapse like an empty\\r\\neggshell under pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nHOLD THE FORT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister was wakened by a sound of lapping outside his tent. It was a\\r\\nnoise feeble as the meowing of little kittens. At first he thought it\\r\\nmust be a memory from his dream. When he had gone to bed the stars had\\r\\nfilled the sky above the dry and arid mesa where they were camped. No\\r\\nrain could have fallen in sufficient quantity to make even a rivulet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the rippling continued. The source of it puzzled the engineer. He\\r\\nflung back the bedding and rose. A chill shocked through him. His feet\\r\\nwere in ice-cold water an inch or two deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nRapidly he dressed and then stepped through the flap of the tent. A\\r\\nshallow sheet of water covered the ground except where there were\\r\\nhillocks. Apparently it was flowing toward the south, as though before\\r\\nthe pressure of a greater volume not in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug walked to the tent of his chief and called him. Merrick answered\\r\\nsleepily, but at the words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrouble at the dam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he became instantly\\r\\nalert. Three minutes later he joined his assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne glance satisfied him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither by word nor manner did he betray what a blow this was to him.\\r\\nThat which he had given two of the best years of his life for, had\\r\\nworked and fought for with all the brains and strength he possessed,\\r\\nwas now only a menace to the community instead of a hope. It was a\\r\\nstaggering disappointment. He had builded so surely, so safely, yet\\r\\nsomewhere must have been a miscalculation that had brought disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably coming through the Quarter Circle ranch,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsuggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better rouse the men and get right up there. There may be\\r\\ndanger if the valley gets flooded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug did not wait for the others. His words had expressed only palely\\r\\nthe alarm he felt. If the break in the dam was a serious one--and it\\r\\nmust be to have reached the mesa so quickly--the Quarter Circle must\\r\\ninevitably be flooded. He knew Betty was at her ranch. One of the men\\r\\nhad mentioned in his hearing that he had seen her and Ruth going up the\\r\\nafternoon before. He was worried--very greatly worried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis long strides carried him over the ground fast, but his fears moved\\r\\nfaster. Presently he quickened his pace to a run. Dawn was at hand. He\\r\\nwas splashing through water five or six inches deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwinging round a bend in the road, he pulled up for a moment in dismay.\\r\\nThrough the gap in the hogback, beyond which was the Quarter Circle D E\\r\\nranch, a solid stream of water was pouring. Its flow was as steady and\\r\\nas constant as that of a river.\\r\\n\\r\\nCut off from the road, he splashed through a deepening stream to the\\r\\nfoot of the hogback. It was a stiff quarter of an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s climb to reach\\r\\nthe rock-rim below the ridge. He grudged the two or three minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\ndelay in finding a practicable ascent up the twenty-five-foot rim, for\\r\\nhe was in a desperate hurry. Hand over hand he went up the face of the\\r\\nrock, clinging to projecting knobs, to faults in the surface, and to\\r\\nshrubbery rooted in narrow crevices. Over the edge of the sandstone he\\r\\ndrew himself to the level surface above.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne glance from the summit showed him a valley submerged. Most of the\\r\\ncattle had evidently escaped to the higher ground, warned by the first\\r\\nof the flood as it poured down. He could see the upper hillside dotted\\r\\nwith them. The barn, the bunkhouse, the ranch house itself, were all\\r\\ngone. Fragments of them might be made out on the surface of the lake\\r\\nthat had formed--if one could call a pent-up, raging torrent by such a\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes swept the valley in search of the ranch house. He found one of\\r\\nthe eaves sticking out of the current. All the rest of the overturned\\r\\nbuilding was under water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strength oozed from his body. He was terribly shaken. If Betty was\\r\\nin the house--and he had no reason to suppose that she was not--she\\r\\nmust have gone down in the flood. He could not, he would not believe\\r\\nit. And yet--\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his glance moved down the valley. His gaze stopped at some rock\\r\\nspires known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSteeples.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some part of a building, much battered\\r\\nby the waves, was caught there. Even as he looked, his heart leaped.\\r\\nFor from a window a white flag was streaming. He could see now that\\r\\nsome one was leaning out and waving a sheet or a tablecloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hurried down the hogback, every nerve of him quivering with desire\\r\\nto answer that appeal for help. He must get to her--at once--before the\\r\\nsmashing current tore down and devoured her precarious and doubtful\\r\\nhaven. Even as he went leaping down the hillside to the shore, his mind\\r\\nwas considering ways and means.\\r\\n\\r\\nA swimmer could not make it straight through the tumbling waters to the\\r\\nSteeples. He would be swept down and miss his goal. From what point\\r\\nshould he start? He tried to decide this as he ran up the valley close\\r\\nto the edge of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposite the point where the pasture-wire fence ran up the hill, a spit\\r\\nof higher land extended into the flooded area. He found a cedar post\\r\\nflung up by the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug took off his shoes and his coat. He waded out, pushing the post\\r\\nbefore him. Presently he was in deep water. The swift current was\\r\\nsweeping him before it. He fought to get farther out in the stream,\\r\\nbut he saw that the fencepost was impeding him. It came to him that he\\r\\nwould be carried past the Steeples if he could not make more headway\\r\\nacross the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe let the fencepost go and struck straight across with a strong, long\\r\\nstroke. The drag of the rushing water was very powerful, and he had\\r\\ncontinually to watch out for floating planks and timbers racing toward\\r\\nthe gap between the hogbacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold from the melted snow in the uplands chilled him to the marrow.\\r\\nHe had not fully rebuilt his blood from the illness he had been\\r\\nthrough. Before he had been in the stream many minutes, he knew that\\r\\nthe force in him was failing. The velocity of the flow was too mighty\\r\\nfor him to resist. Tossed here and there by conflicting sets of the\\r\\ncurrent, he drifted as helplessly as a chip in a rough sea. His arms\\r\\nmoved feebly. His legs were as though weighted. Soon now, he had no\\r\\ndoubt, his head would sink and the waters close above it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, out of a clear sky, a miracle occurred. It took the form of a\\r\\nrope that dropped from heaven, descended in a loop over his head and\\r\\none arm, tightened, and dragged him from the racing channel into an\\r\\neddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree men were at the other end of the rope. They were standing on the\\r\\nroof of a one-story building that had stranded on a submerged island.\\r\\nA group of three cottonwoods had caught the floating building and held\\r\\nit against the pressure of the flood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhausted swimmer was dragged to the roof. He lay there, completely\\r\\ndone, conscious, but no more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere in Mexico you haided for, anyhow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a voice drawled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister looked up. The speaker was the cowboy Dusty, who had once\\r\\ndragged him back to the Diamond Bar K ranch at the end of a rope. One\\r\\nof the others he recognized as the lank rider Burt, who also had been\\r\\npresent on that occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucky you were here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the rescued man said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was all in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s twice I done roped you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dusty reminded him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sure got bawled\\r\\nout proper last time. Say, howcome you in this Arctic Ocean, anyhow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was trying to reach Betty Reed. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a broken bit of the house\\r\\nat the Steeples. At least some one is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s her all right. We drifted down here \\xe2\\x80\\x99bout an hour ago. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been\\r\\nsingin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSinging?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHymns. \\xe2\\x80\\x98How Firm a Foundation,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like that. Her an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the kid an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nMandy. Say, fellow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been one heluva night if any one asks you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBurt spoke. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas you tryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to swim to where Miss Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ngot guts. You didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hardly have a chanct with all the water in the\\r\\nhills a-b\\xe2\\x80\\x99ilin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be far from here if you heard her sing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot fur. Mebbe a hundred yards. Mebbe twice that fur. But I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ntackle that swim for a million dollars. I never claimed to be no fish,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nDusty explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDownstream from here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep. Over thataway. See the Steeples through the trees?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cowboy\\r\\nasked for information: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much longer do you reckon the water from\\r\\nyore dam is gonna keep on comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot much longer now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sure had a plenty. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they call this a dry country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWish you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rub my arms and legs. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m cold,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey massaged him till he glowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug stepped to the edge of the roof and studied the current. Presently\\r\\nhe spoke to the others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch obliged for your help, boys. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be\\r\\ngoing now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoing where?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Dusty, mouth open from astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo the Steeples.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou darned son of a gun! What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got into you, fellow? You been drowned\\r\\nonce to-day--\\xe2\\x80\\x99most. Ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that enough?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can make it there now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The puncher was emphatic. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe come through by the\\r\\nskin of our teeth, with a roof under us. This ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no swimmin\\xe2\\x80\\x99-pool.\\r\\nIf you know when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re well off, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTug did not wait to argue the matter. His business would not wait. He\\r\\nwaved a hand and dived from the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem before him was a simple one. Whether it could be solved, he\\r\\ndid not know. While being carried down, he must fight his way as far\\r\\nacross the valley as possible. He might be swept close to the Steeples\\r\\nand yet not be able to make a landing. If he failed to do this, he was\\r\\nlost.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not stop to see what headway he was making. All his energy went\\r\\ninto the strokes with which he cleft the water. With every ounce he\\r\\nhad he fought to gain distance. Within a minute or two he would know\\r\\nwhether he had won.\\r\\n\\r\\nA log careened down. He stopped swimming, in order not to be struck.\\r\\nThe current flung him round. Just below him were the spires of rock for\\r\\nwhich he was making.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment the current was driving him past. A long pole stuck\\r\\nout into the water from the wreck of the house and rose and fell\\r\\nwith the swell. He caught hold of this and flung his body across it.\\r\\nPrecariously he clung, several times almost losing his hold. He edged\\r\\nalong it, carefully, until he had worked into the shell of the house.\\r\\nOne wall was gone entirely. Another had been partially ripped out.\\r\\nThrough these openings the river raced.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug let go the telephone pole to which he had been clinging and swam to\\r\\nthe stairway. Here he found a foothold and sank down, half in the water\\r\\nand half out. Again the strength had gone out of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, marvelously, as he lay there panting, the icy chill clutching\\r\\nat his heart, there came to him a clear, warm voice raised in a hymn.\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice! His heart exulted. He listened to the brave words,\\r\\ngallantly sung.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was singing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHold the Fort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nBEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you fink Jesus will come, Betty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a small voice inquired anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll send some one, dear--Dad or Lon or--some one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth considered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you fink he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll send him in time for bweakfast? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nofful hungwy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty did not know about breakfast, but aloud she quite confidently\\r\\nthought so. Hope was resurgent in her heart. The worst of the flood\\r\\nwas over. Its level had already receded two or three inches. She had\\r\\njust discovered that. Within the past hour its fury had beaten in and\\r\\ntorn away one wall of the house. Another had been partially destroyed.\\r\\nThe shell of a building that was left could not much longer endure.\\r\\nBut she did not believe that much time would pass before a rescue was\\r\\nattempted. A few minutes since she had heard Dusty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheerful shout,\\r\\nand, though he was probably marooned himself, it was a comfort to know\\r\\nthat her party was not the only one in the devastated valley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy fry-pans an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 my cook-stove an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 my kitchen are plumb scattered every\\r\\nwhich way. I reckon I nevah will see them no mo\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mandy mourned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nlas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 week I done bought dem luminous dishes frum dat peddler.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAluminum, Mandy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDas all right. Luminous or luminum, I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99 carin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which. What I wuz\\r\\nsayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMandy stopped, to let out a yell of fright. A dripping figure, hatless,\\r\\ncoatless, shoeless, was standing at the head of the stairs. The face\\r\\nwas white and haggard. The body drooped against the door jamb for\\r\\nsupport.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraight from Betty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart a cry of joy leaped. He had come to her.\\r\\nThrough all the peril of the flood he had come to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTug!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, irradiate, and moved to him with hands outstretched.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was profoundly touched, but his words reflected the commonplace of\\r\\nthe surface mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he warned.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed that to scorn, a little hysterically, and went blindly into\\r\\nhis arms, a smirr of mist in her eyes. All night she had been under a\\r\\nstrain, had carried the responsibility of facing peril for all of them.\\r\\nNow she cast that burden, without a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hesitation, on broader\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis lip trembled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered, as his arms went round\\r\\nher. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHorribly afraid till Dusty told me he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d heard you singing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m _glad_ you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m _glad_!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she wailed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held her close, as though he were afraid that even yet malign fate\\r\\nmight try to snatch her from him. Beyond a shadow of a doubt he knew\\r\\nnow that if they lived nothing could keep them apart. She had been\\r\\nright. The sin that had held him from her was a dead and shriveled\\r\\nthing. It was no more a part of him than are discarded horns part of a\\r\\nliving stag.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug murmured, with emotion, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank God! Thank God!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInto this stress of feeling Ruth interjected herself. She saw no reason\\r\\nfor being out of the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid Jesus send you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, tugging at his shirt-sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not quite understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth explained, with the impatience of superiority. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99chu know?\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hold the fort, f\\xe2\\x80\\x99r I am comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, Jesus signals still.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Betty said \\xe2\\x80\\x99f he\\r\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d send some one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure God sent him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said, her voice unsteady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBress de Lawd,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mandy chimed in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow you git us off\\xe2\\x80\\x99n this yere\\r\\nbusted house, Mr. Man, fer I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like no rampagin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roun\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thisaway on\\r\\nno ocean v\\xe2\\x80\\x99yages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty explained that he could not get them off just yet. They would\\r\\nhave to wait to be rescued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhaffor he come \\xe2\\x80\\x99f he ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gwine rescue us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mandy sniffed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl smiled into the eyes of her lover. She knew why he had come,\\r\\nand in his presence by some magic the fear had dropped from her heart.\\r\\nThe current dragging at their tottering place of refuge could not shake\\r\\nher sure confidence that all was well with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister looked the situation over with the trained eye of an\\r\\nengineer. He must get them to the rocks before what was left of the\\r\\nhouse collapsed. But how? He could not take them with him through the\\r\\nwaves beating against the sandstone. It was not certain that he could\\r\\nmake a safe landing himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if he could reach the flat ledge above, he might contrive some kind\\r\\nof bridge out of the dead and down trees lying there. It would be a\\r\\nhazardous affair, but he was in no position to be choice about ways and\\r\\nmeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBriefly he explained to Betty his plan. She clung to him, tremulously,\\r\\nreluctant to let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMust you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured, and shuddered at the black waters rushing\\r\\npast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMust you go in again? Couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we just wait here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Fraid not, dear. You feel how the house is shaking. It can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last\\r\\nlong. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to reach the rocks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been pretty awful, Tug. When the wall was swept out, I thought--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nShe shook that appalling memory out of her mind and smiled at him,\\r\\nshyly, adorably. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not afraid as long as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reassured. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I can do it, Betty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I help?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Knot together two sheets to make a rope. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need it later.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped from a window, found himself caught in an irresistible tide\\r\\nthat swept him away like a chip. It was all over in a moment. He was\\r\\nwhirled round and dashed into the rocks. The impact knocked the breath\\r\\nout of him. He clung, desperately, to a jutting spar of sandstone,\\r\\nhardly conscious of what he was doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe life went out of him. When he came to consciousness, he lay on the\\r\\nshelf, feet and legs still in the water. He noticed that his head was\\r\\nbleeding and for an instant wondered what it was all about.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice reached him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTug! Tug!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was leaning out of the window of the tossing house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose and waved a hand. Strength flowed back to him in waves. The\\r\\nhaze lifted from his brain. He visualized the problem of the bridge and\\r\\nset about meeting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dead trees on the ledge were young pines. They had been broken\\r\\noff from the roots, probably blown from the crevices because they\\r\\nwere insufficiently rooted. He dragged one to the edge of the sloping\\r\\nsurface of the boulder and raised it till it was upright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBack from the window, Betty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer head and shoulders disappeared. He balanced the tree-trunk\\r\\ncarefully, measured the distance again with his eye, and let it fall\\r\\ntoward the house. The end of it crashed through the window panes and\\r\\nlanded on the casing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug dragged forward a second pole, shouted a warning to Betty once\\r\\nmore, and balanced the pine carefully. A second later it toppled\\r\\nforward, urged by a slight push, and the butt dropped into the casing\\r\\nbeside the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this frail bridge Tug crept on hands and knees toward the building.\\r\\nThe house tilted down and back. The end of the logs slipped. Betty\\r\\nclung to them, desperately, while Hollister edged forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take that rope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nMandy handed out the sheets. As the bridge swayed and dipped, he\\r\\nknotted the linen round the logs, tying them together in two places. It\\r\\nwas a hazardous business, but he got through with it safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few seconds later he was in the bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRuth first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTie her to my back. She might get frightened and let\\r\\nloose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child whimpered as he crept out upon the logs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming too in a minute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her sister called cheerfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust\\r\\nshut your eyes, Ruthie, and hang tight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrow suspension bridge swung dizzily with every lift of the\\r\\nracing flood. Tug inched along, his feet locked together beneath the\\r\\nwater that reached for him. Once he lost his balance from a lurch of\\r\\nthe logs, but he managed to recover himself. Ruth screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told her, and presently was pulling himself upon\\r\\nthe rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister left the little girl there and recrossed to the building.\\r\\nBetty crawled out on the bridge, the man close behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked down, and was appalled. The pour of the stream that was so\\r\\nclose carried the power of a mountain river in flood. Her body swayed.\\r\\nShe could never get across--never in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice of her lover came, strong and comforting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSteady, Bess.\\r\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis assurance went through her veins like wine. Tug was behind her. Of\\r\\ncourse, they would reach the rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe logs dipped almost to the water at the middle. A monster that\\r\\nseemed to be alive dragged at her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Tug!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep going. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re almost across.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd presently they were, safe on the slanting sandstone shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned for Mandy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cayn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t nevah git acrost on that there rickety rack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she moaned.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d bust dem poles spang in two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHollister was not sure himself that they would hold her weight, but\\r\\nhe knew that before many minutes the house was going to break up. He\\r\\ncoaxed and urged her to the attempt, and after she began the crossing\\r\\nhe clung to the end of the bridge with all his weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Mandy got across none of them ever knew. She stopped twice to\\r\\nannounce that she could not do it, but after more exhortation continued\\r\\nedging along. To the very moment when Betty reached a hand to her, she\\r\\ninsisted that she was going to be drownded.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot three minutes after Tug had crossed to the rock shelf, the shell\\r\\nof the house shivered and collapsed. It went out with a rush, and\\r\\npresently was nothing but a lot of floating planks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty watched it go, with trembling lips. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nmurmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis soul went out to her in swift response. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had to come. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nchance. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it was meant to be. Why not? Why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I be near\\r\\nenough to come when you needed me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe caught his hand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou dear boy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she breathed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nobody like you--nobody I ever met,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried in a whisper, as\\r\\nlovers have done since Adam first wooed Eve. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould any one have done\\r\\nmore for me than you? Your faith rebuilt my life. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ever anything,\\r\\nI owe it to you. And now--the greatest gift of all. Why to me? Why not\\r\\nto Merrick, far more worthy of you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her smile was the world-old wisdom Leonardo has expressed in his\\r\\nMona Lisa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLove doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go by merit, does it? I wonder if Justin isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too\\r\\nworthy. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect in himself--complete. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGod knows I need you, if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reason,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said humbly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot fair to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it Justin who swam through the flood to save me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked\\r\\nsoftly, her face aglow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing a much more sensible thing--building a raft to get you\\r\\nashore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho wants her lover to do the sensible thing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She turned to him\\r\\nimpulsively, warm, tender, luminous, a rapt young thing caught in a\\r\\nsurge of generous emotion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want mine to do just what you did--come\\r\\nthrough water or through fire instantly when I needed you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love you\\r\\nnow, if I never had before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if Merrick had come?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come. It wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be Justin to do that--to fling his life\\r\\naway on a thousandth chance. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see, Tug? He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tread the\\r\\nmountain-tops--and you do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always giving. If I could only wipe the slate out,\\r\\nBetty--begin my life over again to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said wistfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her deep, soft eyes a dream lingered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just what I want--to\\r\\nbegin everything with you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silly, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m jealous of all those\\r\\nyears when I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have you--of all the sorrows and joys you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had,\\r\\nof the girls and the men you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known--because I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share them with\\r\\nyou. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to know all you think and share all your hopes. If you\\r\\never think, \\xe2\\x80\\x98She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just my wife--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever that. Always, \\xe2\\x80\\x98She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my wife,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he promised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs long as you say it that way, Tug,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she murmured, and clung to him\\r\\nwith a little feminine savagery of possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth, impatient at being ignored, again claimed attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalk to me, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nTug caught her small hand in his. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk to little\\r\\nsister.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you my big brother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty stooped and snatched the child to her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nwhispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this Ruth set the seal of her approval. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoody, I like him. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get me heaps \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heaps of tandy. More\\xe2\\x80\\x99n anybody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TURN OF A CROOKED TRAIL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJake Prowers had intended, while the work of destruction was under\\r\\nway, to return to his ranch and let it take its course. The body of\\r\\nCig would be found, and the tramp would be blamed for the disaster.\\r\\nIt would be remembered that he had already tried once to blow up the\\r\\nworkers in the tunnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cowman knew that public opinion would not hold him blameless. He\\r\\nwould be suspected of instigating the crime, but, with Cig out of the\\r\\nway, nothing could be proved. There would not be the least evidence\\r\\nthat could touch him. He had done a good job in getting rid of the New\\r\\nYork crook. Moreover, he had not lifted a hand against the man. Was he\\r\\nto blame because a drunken loafer lay down and deliberately went to\\r\\nsleep where a charge of dynamite would shortly blow him up?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wise course, Prowers knew, was to retire for a time to the\\r\\nbackground and to be greatly surprised when he was told that the dam\\r\\nhad gone out. But there was in him a desire stronger than prudence. He\\r\\nwanted to see the flood racing through the Quarter Circle D E and its\\r\\nwaters being wasted on the Flat Tops which they were to have reclaimed.\\r\\nHalf his pleasure in the evil thing he had done would be lost if he\\r\\ncould not be on the ground to gloat over Clint Reed and Merrick.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the night had fully spent itself, he was on his way to the\\r\\nQuarter Circle D E. The sun was almost up over the hilltops by the\\r\\ntime he looked down from the rim of the little valley upon the havoc\\r\\nhe had wrought. The ranch buildings were all gone, though he could\\r\\nsee battered remnants of them in the swirling stream. Fences had been\\r\\nrooted out. A young orchard below the house was completely submerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe destruction was even greater than he had anticipated. It had not\\r\\noccurred to him that any lives would be lost, but he judged now that\\r\\nthe men at the ranch had probably been drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis interest drew him closer, to a point from which he could see the\\r\\nlower part of the valley. He made here two discoveries. Three men were\\r\\nout in the flooded district on the roof of a low building. Another\\r\\ngroup, on the shore line below him, were building two rafts, evidently\\r\\nwith a rescue in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the workmen caught sight of Prowers and called to him. Jake\\r\\ndecided it was better to go down, since he had been recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at the dam engineer and subdued a cackle. It might easily be\\r\\npossible to go too far just now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou move yore reservoir down here last night, Merrick?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked\\r\\nmaliciously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWisht I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 known. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d kinda liked to \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 seen you\\r\\nbringin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick said nothing. He continued to trim an edge from a plank with\\r\\na hatchet. But though he did not look at Prowers his mind was full of\\r\\nhim. He had been thinking about him all morning. Why had the dam gone\\r\\nout? Had it been dynamited? Was this the work of him and his hangers-on?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Seems like you might \\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\xe2\\x80\\x99 let a fellow know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the cowman complained in\\r\\nhis high, thin voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack appeared, dragging a plank he had salvaged. He looked at Prowers,\\r\\nand instantly his mind was full of suspicion. He had known the old man\\r\\nthirty years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Lo, Don,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Jake with an amiable edge of irony. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlways doing\\r\\nsome neighborly good deed, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a Boy Scout by an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by\\r\\nif you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack looked at him with level eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowcome you here so early, Jake?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe! On my way to Wild Horse. Come to that, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m some surprised to see\\r\\nyou, Don.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI been workin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for Mr. Merrick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the range rider said curtly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhy I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here. But mostly when you go to Wild Horse you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ramble\\r\\nround by the Quarter Circle, Jake. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m kinda wonderin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 how you happened\\r\\nround this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuntin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for a two-year-old reported strayed over thisaway. Lucky I\\r\\ncame. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He turned to Merrick unctuously, his\\r\\nbleached eyes mildly solicitous. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thing on earth I can do,\\r\\nwhy I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to go to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men were carrying one of the rafts to the edge of the water.\\r\\nMerrick gave his whole attention to the business of manning and\\r\\nequipping it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis raft heads for the Steeples,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo volunteers\\r\\nwanted to steer it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack stopped chewing tobacco. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow about you \\xe2\\x80\\x99n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me, Jake?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked\\r\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor once Prowers was taken at disadvantage. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any sailor, Don.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone of us are. But you offered to help. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Course, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re scared.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cattleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head moved forward, his eyes narrowed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you say\\r\\nscared?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure. Last time I seen you, Jake, you was guessin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I had a yellow\\r\\nstreak. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wonderin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that about you now. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m aimin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to go on this\\r\\nboat. Are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The range rider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gaze bored into the eyes of the man\\r\\nhe had served so long. It was chill and relentless as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers was no coward, but he had not the least intention of voyaging\\r\\nacross the flood in so frail a craft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo old, Don. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t strong as some o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 these young bucks. You go on,\\r\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when you come back we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll settle about that yellow streak for good\\r\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raft set out on its perilous journey. A young surveyor had offered\\r\\nto go as the second member of the crew.\\r\\n\\r\\nPegs had been driven into the edges of the raft for rowlocks. The oars\\r\\nhad been hastily fashioned out of planking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe float drifted into the rapid water and was caught by the current.\\r\\nBlack and his companion pulled lustily to make headway across stream.\\r\\nThere was a minute of desperate struggle before the craft swung round,\\r\\ndriven by the force of water tumbling pell-mell down.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rowlock snapped. Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oar was dragged from his hand. A log crashed\\r\\ninto the raft and buckled it up. Caught by a cross-tide, the two who\\r\\nhad been flung into the water were swept into an eddy. They swam and\\r\\nclambered ashore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had not been five minutes since Black had embarked on this\\r\\nadventure, but, as he moved up the shore toward the little group of men\\r\\nhe had left, he saw that something unexpected had developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers was in the saddle and he had his gun out. It was threatening\\r\\nMerrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s group of rescuers. The cattleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thin, high voice came\\r\\nclear to the range rider.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you touch me! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fill you full of lead sure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s you\\r\\nmove an inch, Merrick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, swiftly, he swung his horse round and galloped away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the hubbub of explanation Black gathered the facts. The man whom\\r\\nProwers had lured from the dam with a message that his wife was worse\\r\\nhad stopped for later information at a ranch house on the way down. He\\r\\nhad telephoned his house and talked with his wife. He was perplexed,\\r\\nbut relieved. After an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chat at the ranch, he had headed for the\\r\\ndam and reached the scene in time to identify Prowers as he left.\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute ago he had arrived and told what he knew. The engineer had\\r\\naccused Prowers point-blank of the crime. His men had talked of\\r\\nlynching, and Prowers had fled.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack did not discuss the situation. He returned to camp, saddled a\\r\\nhorse, and took from his roll of bedding a revolver. Five minutes later\\r\\nhe was jogging into the hills. A day of settlement had come between\\r\\nhim and the man who had deflected him from the straight and well-worn\\r\\ntrails of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew the size of his job. Jake was a bad man with a gun, swift as\\r\\nchain lightning, deadly accurate in aim. It was not likely that he\\r\\nwould let himself be taken alive. The chances were that any man who\\r\\nengaged in a duel with him would stay on the field of battle. Don\\r\\naccepted this likelihood quietly, grimly. He meant to get Jake Prowers,\\r\\nto bring him in alive if possible, dead, if he must.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range rider had no qualms of conscience. Prowers had probably\\r\\ndrowned several innocent people, very likely Betty and her little\\r\\nsister among them. The fellow was dangerous as a mad wolf. The time had\\r\\ncome to blot him out. He, Don Black, was the man that ought to do it.\\r\\nIf Jake surrendered, good enough; he would take him to Wild Horse. If\\r\\nnot--\\r\\n\\r\\nSo his simple mind reasoned foggily. He was essentially a deputy\\r\\nsheriff, though, of course, he had not had time to get Daniels to\\r\\nappoint him. That was merely a formality, anyhow.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon rode straight to the Circle J P ranch. He swung from the saddle and\\r\\ndropped the lines in front of the house. As he did so, he noticed two\\r\\nbuzzards circling high in the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nProwers must have seen him coming, for when Don turned toward the porch\\r\\nthe little man was standing there watching him. Black moved forward,\\r\\nspurs jingling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes did not lift from those of Prowers. At the foot of the steps\\r\\nhe stopped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come after you, Jake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said evenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skim-milk eyes in the leathery face narrowed. They were hard and\\r\\nshining pin-points of wary challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for, Don?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor blowin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up the dam, you yellow wolf.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen come a-shootin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forty-fives blazed. The roar of them filled the air. Across the\\r\\nnarrow range between the two men bullets stabbed with deadly precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack swayed on his feet. He knew he was shot through and through in\\r\\nseveral places, that he could count his life in minutes, perhaps in\\r\\nseconds. Through the smoke rifts he could see the crouching figure\\r\\nflinging death at him. Still firing, he sank to his knees. He could no\\r\\nlonger lift the revolver, and as his body plunged to the ground the\\r\\nlast cartridge was exploded into the sod.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the steps toward him rolled the shrunken form of his foe, slowly,\\r\\nwithout volition, every muscle lax. They lay close to each other,\\r\\nonly their eyes alive to glare defiance till the film of dissolution\\r\\nshadowed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey must have passed out within a few seconds of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\nBETTY DISCOVERS WHY SHE IS YOUNG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the house Tug had brought matches with him. He gathered pine\\r\\nboughs and lit a fire upon the rock slab. The warmth of it went through\\r\\nthem and restored their diminished vitality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going down fast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betty said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee the rock. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s several\\r\\ninches lower.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Merrick will be here soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for Ruth and Mandy, the girl did not care how long he was. She\\r\\nwas young, and in love. Beside her sat the man who was to be her mate.\\r\\nA flash of the eye brought happiness. A touch of the hand thrilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven when she did not look at him, she was acutely conscious of his\\r\\npresence. Without turning her head she saw the line of the razor stroke\\r\\nwhere the golden down ceased on his tanned cheek, was aware of the\\r\\ngallant set of the fine head on strong shoulders. Oh, it was good to be\\r\\nnear him, to know that out of all the millions of men in the world she\\r\\nhad found her mate. There was in her a strange, a primitive, instinct\\r\\nto accept his leadership, a desire to be subject to his wishes and\\r\\ncommands.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled. This was not like her. Perhaps it was a merely temporary\\r\\naberration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre we really all alike?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked herself, trying to understand\\r\\nthis love-complex that already was changing her point of view. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nwant to be free, want to express ourselves. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking of nothing\\r\\nelse. And then--enter a man. Our house of cards comes toppling down,\\r\\nand we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care a bit. Sometimes, of course, he isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the right man.\\r\\nThen--tragedy, I suppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young philosopher, looking at her hero, was very sure he was the\\r\\nright man. Her certainty went beyond evidence, beyond faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s raft reached them about noon. He was admirable in the r\\xc3\\xb4le\\r\\nof rescuer. Efficiency showed in everything he did, even to the\\r\\nsandwiches, and coffee in a thermos bottle, which he had not forgotten\\r\\nto bring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Dad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Betty, between bites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe and Forbes were at First View last night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes he know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re safe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headed for home now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the hour they were back at the Diamond Bar K. Clint drove up a\\r\\nfew minutes later, Forbes beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cattleman took his children in his arms and held them close. He\\r\\ncould not talk without breaking down. He dared not put his feeling into\\r\\nwords. They had come back to him from the dead--these two. Inside of\\r\\nhim a river of unshed tears flowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty left him making over Ruth and slipped into the next room where\\r\\nsome one was waiting for her. Lon Forbes was telling Hollister some\\r\\nnews.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c... Jake\\xe2\\x80\\x99s men found \\xe2\\x80\\x99em there dead, not three feet apart. Both guns\\r\\nempty. Four bullets in Jake\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body, five in Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99s--an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 most any one of\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99em a fatal wound. They were that game they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quit. It takes a\\r\\nheap o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 killin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to finish an old-timer, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTremulously, Betty moved forward. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLon told her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry about Black, but Jake sure had it comin\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nfinished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreman passed into the other room to tell Clint the news.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a hushed voice Betty talked the tragedy over with Tug. The swiftness\\r\\nwith which Nemesis had overtaken and obliterated Prowers was appalling\\r\\nto her. She had a momentary vision, vivid and amazingly sure, of God in\\r\\nthe shadows passing judgment on the sins of men. It was as though they\\r\\nwere back in the days of the old Hebrew prophets when the hand of the\\r\\nLord stretched out and laid itself upon wicked men for their punishment\\r\\nwhen the measure of their time was full.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe tried to stand above the law in this valley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hollister told her.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wanted to stop progress--said there shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be any dam to reclaim\\r\\nthe Flat Tops for settlers. Merrick will rebuild it. The land will be\\r\\nwatered. Your ranch will be good as ever in three months. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be\\r\\nburied and forgotten.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd poor Don Black?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she whispered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Don, who never had a chance\\r\\nin this world, or, if he had one, muddled it so badly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could only hope that Don had gone to a better-ordered world where\\r\\ncircumstances did not dominate good intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sense of tragedy lingered just now no longer than a cinema\\r\\npicture. The life urge in her clamored for expression. No world could\\r\\nbe a sad one with her and Tug in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I go in and tell your father now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the young man asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She made a rustling little motion toward him and found herself\\r\\nin his arms. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it splendid, boy?

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
